# Technical Terms

:::info[A must-read before you proceed with the rest of the guide.]

Some terms in this guide will be repeated a lot and thus it is easier for you (to read and understand faster) and me (to type obviously) to understand them all. Understand this section very well before you continue to read the rest of the guide. It looks like a lot of terms but many are quite common sense, and some are used in the game itself.

:::

## General

- Particles

    These are what you get for destroying invaders. They come in blue, green and gold colors. Blue ones are considered the lightest as they get pulled in by your ship the fastest, but they only give you very little energy to recharge your Aura. Green ones are heavier and they are pulled in by your ship a little slower, but they give you more energy than the blue ones. Gold particles are the heaviest and they take a lot of time to be absorbed by your ship, but they give the most energy.

- Shielded <img src="/terms/shielded.png" style={{zoom:0.3,verticalAlign:'middle'}}/>

    These refer to the blue outline you see on some types of invaders. It also makes the invaders themselves look more blue. These protect invaders from damage while this blue outline is up. After dealing damage to it for some time, the blue outline fades. The icon above represents the presence of Shielded invaders in a mission.

- Armored <img src="/terms/armored.png" style={{zoom:0.3,verticalAlign:'middle'}}/>

    Refers to the gold outline around some types of invaders, these invaders resist some damage if it is not tagged as Armor Piercing. The icon above represents the presence of Armored invaders in a mission.

- Unprotected <img src="/terms/unprotected.png" style={{zoom:0.3,verticalAlign:'middle'}}/>

    Refers to the grey outline around some types of invaders. All weapons do normal damage to unprotected invaders, but some weapons can do bonus critical damage to unprotected invaders. The icon above represents the presence of Unprotected invaders in a mission.

- Hull

    Refers to the other parts of an invader (which are not turrets or the cockpit) where shooting at it will cause damage to the invader itself (but not any turret).

- Crit

    To score a critical hit on an invader by chance and using a HI weapon, thus dealing bonus damage.

- Graze

    This refers to the technique where your core is dangerously close to a bullet. You can see a small red slash moving from 9 o'clock to 3 o'clock near your core for every bullet you graze. The distance of the red slash away from your core is the maximum distance away from a bullet you can be to successfully perform a graze. You can also graze off a laser, this happens when the white burst of energy runs through the white line (which happens just milliseconds before the white line turns red and becomes dangerous) zooms past near enough to your ship's core. Grazing rewards you a bit of energy to recharge your Aura. You may only graze the same bullet once.

    On the left you can see how the red slash looks like JUST after grazing the bullet (shuriken) above the core. On the right you can see how grazing a laser works. Grazing a laser will also have the red slash, although not visible below.

    

- Phase Out

    This refers to the fading time of several Auras and Zens. Some of these abilities continue to last for a short/very short time even after their strength is depleted or the Zen is cancelled. The most obvious one is Chrono Field, where the term Phase Out literally refers to the effect of invincibility from Chrono Field continuing to last on your ship for an additional 0.5s.

## Ships

- Ship

    What you control during gameplay.

- Core

    This is the blinking blue dot on your ship and the only part of your ship that matters. If a bullet or laser (when active, which means red in color) touches it, you die.

- Projectiles

    These refer to each and every distinct shape or short line/curve that a ship produces. Each of these that hit an invader produces an impact sound and this is how a ship does damage to invaders. They have a certain travel speed that varies by ship and do not instantaneously hit invaders unlike beam weapons (self-explanatory).

- SB <img src="/terms/sb.png" style={{zoom:0.3,verticalAlign:'middle'}}/>

    Shield Breaker. SB main weapons deal bonus damage to Shields, destroying them much faster than other types of weapons. Once the shield is down, they deal normal damage. Ships that have SB main weapons are tagged with the icon above.

- AP <img src="/terms/ap.png" style={{zoom:0.3,verticalAlign:'middle'}}/>

    Armor Piercing. AP main weapons deal full damage on armor invaders, unlike SB or HI weapons. They also deal normal damage on all other types of invaders. Ships that have AP main weapons are tagged with the icon above.

- HI <img src="/terms/hi.png" style={{zoom:0.3,verticalAlign:'middle'}}/>

    High Impact. HI main weapons have a chance to deal critical hits on unprotected invaders, invaders that have their Shield destroyed, or if you hit the cockpit of Armor invaders. Ships that have HI main weapons are tagged with the icon above.

- x-y-z (where x,y,z are integers)

    Refers to a ship's stats. x is the Level of its Main Weapon, y is the Level of its Aura, and z is the Level of its Zen. For example, 1-2-0 means the ship has a Level 1 Main Weapon, a Level 2 Aura, and a Zen which is not unlocked (thus Level 0).

- Max <img src="/terms/max.png" style={{zoom:0.4,verticalAlign:'middle'}}/>

    To upgrade one of the ship's stats, whether it is main weapon, Aura, or Zen to Level 5. Maxing a ship means upgrading it to 5-5-5. The upgrade icon (which appears in the Play Tab only) when the ship stat is not yet maxed is shown below:

- Ult <img src="/terms/ult.png" style={{zoom:0.4,verticalAlign:'middle'}}/>

    To upgrade one of the ship's stats, whether it is main weapon, Aura, or Zen to the Ultimate level (sometimes referred to as Level 6), which costs more than 1000¢. Ult-ing a ship means to upgrade it completely to 6-6-6. The upgrade icon (which appears in the Play Tab only) when the ship stat is ready to upgrade to ult level is shown below:

- BoB <img src="/terms/bob.png" style={{zoom:0.4,verticalAlign:'middle'}}/>

    Best of Best. This badge is earned when you are first (#1) in the daily mission leaderboard of the highest rank and league, Marshal S4, when the daily mission has ended.

- sBoB <img src="/terms/sbob.png" style={{zoom:0.4,verticalAlign:'middle'}}/>

    Specialist Best of Best. This badge is earned when you are first (#1) in the specialist mission leaderboard of the highest rank, Marshal (league does not matter) when the specialist mission has ended.

- oBoB <img src="/terms/obob.png" style={{zoom:0.4,verticalAlign:'middle'}}/>

    Ogon is fine. This badge is earned when you clear a Marshal S4 mission with Ogon on the leaderboard. Attention: if you cover your scord with other ships, you will not be able to claim this badge.

- Against all odds  <img src="/terms/aao.png" style={{zoom:0.3,verticalAlign:'middle'}}/>

    This badge is earned when you complete a very hard mission. In particular, when the clear rate of **a Marshal mission** is lower than 3%, all the players cleared the mission will earn this badge.

- Pin of Challenge <img src="/terms/challenge.png" style={{zoom:0.4,verticalAlign:'middle'}}/>

    A badge out of print. Earned when you played Phoenix 2 in Apple's physical offline Store and you contacted EL.

- Pin of Excellence <img src="/terms/phoenix.png" style={{zoom:0.15,verticalAlign:'middle'}}/> <img src="/terms/excellence.png" style={{zoom:0.1,verticalAlign:'middle'}}/>

    The badge awarded for players who have made great contributions to the Phoenix 2 game or community. Along with a physical badge, EL will directly message you if he thinks that you deserve this badge.

## Invaders

- Invader

    The antagonists of the game. You use your ships' weapons to shoot them down.

- Sinister

    These refer to invaders that have camouflage patterns on them ie grey spots on their exterior. Sinister invaders are either Shield or Armor invaders.

- Turret

    The source of bullets and lasers which can be destroyed.

- Cockpit

    Refers to the very small region that are situated at the bottom center of invaders. For invaders with even number of turrets on them, you can see a shining oval shape at the center, which is either green (for Sinister invaders) or red / orange (for other invaders) in color. For other invaders, you just have to take it as it is there even though you can hardly see it.

- Type

    This refers to the 7 different types of invaders mentioned below, namely, Sparrows, Ravens, Herons, Eagles, Vultures, Condor and Roc.

- Affinity

    This refers to the 3 different coatings of invaders, namely, Unprotected, Shielded and Armored.

- Dense

    This term is used to describe wave formations. When I say the wave is very dense, it means that there are a lot of invaders on screen, and in extreme cases such as higher rank daily missions, you may see invaders partially overlapping each other. Generally speaking, if you see a wave, feel immediately overwhelmed and you don't even feel like counting the number of invaders on field, then it is dense.

- Heavy

    This term is used to describe wave formations. When I say the wave is very heavy, it means that there is an unusual amount of large invaders. Large invaders refer to Herons and above. In Act 1 & 2, if you see 4 or more Herons, it is a heavy wave. In Act 3 and above, if you see 6 Herons and above, it is heavy. If you see more than 3 Eagles on field, it is also a heavy wave. If you see a Vulture and 2 Eagles (also includes together with anything else), it is also a heavy wave.

- Light

    Obviously, the opposite of Heavy and also used to describe wave formations. If you see a wave with nothing more than 1 Heron (and a few Sparrows), no more than 6 Ravens, no more than 2 Ravens together with 1 Herons or some Sparrows, or a pure Sparrow wave, then the wave is considered light.

- Medium

    A term also used to describe wave formations, anything in between a Light and Heavy wave is considered Medium.

- Sparrows

    The smallest invaders in the game, rapid random movement and has only 1 launcher. From left to right, Unprotected, Shield, Sinister Shield, Armor, Sinister Armor.

- Ravens

    Small size invaders with 2 turrets, fast random movement. From left to right, Unprotected, Shield, Sinister Armor.

- Herons

    Medium size invaders with 2 turrets and 1 launcher at the centre. Some random movement. From left to right, Unprotected, Shield, Sinister Armor.

- Eagles

    Big size invaders that take up about half the horizontal screen space with 3 turrets. Small random movement.

- Vultures

    Huge invaders that span across the entire screen space with 4 turrets. Minimal random movement.

- Condors <img src="/terms/condor.png" style={{zoom:0.3,verticalAlign:'middle'}}/>

    Gigantic invaders that take up half the screen space with 6 turrets. Near zero movement. Accompanied by only Ravens and/or Sparrows which spawn at the bottom half of the screen immediately after the wave begins in community and specialist missions, while Herons and Eagles may also accompany Condors in daily missions. The icon that indicates the presence of a Condor in a mission is shown below:

    In the images below, from left to right, the affinities of the Condors are as follows: Unprotected, Shield, Armor. NB: Can you identify the ship used in the middle picture based on the projectiles of the main weapon? The answer is NC-150.

- Rocs <img src="/terms/roc.png" style={{zoom:0.3,verticalAlign:'middle'}}/>

    Colossal invaders that take up half the screen space with 10 turrets. Near zero movement. The only invaders that take about 10s to arrive on screen fully (after the wave counter has changed) before they can be hit and its turrets start their firing sequences. Accompanied by only Ravens and/or Sparrows which spawn at the bottom half of the screen immediately after the wave begins in community and specialist missions, while Herons and Eagles may also accompany Rocs in daily missions. The icon that indicates the presence of a Roc in a mission is shown below:

    In the images below, from left to right, the affinities of the Rocs are as follows: From left to right, Unprotected, Shield, Sinister Shield, Armor, Sinister Armor. NB: Can you identify the ships being used in the middle 3 pictures (exclude the 2 extreme left and right pictures), based on the main weapon and/or Aura? The answer from left to right is Phoenix, Beta NC-150 and Hunter.

## Turrets

- Bullets

    Things that are generally bright red on your screen that will destroy your ship if your core touches them.

- Lasers <img src="/terms/laser.png" style={{zoom:0.3,verticalAlign:'middle'}}/>

    The presence of lasers in a mission is indicated by the icon shown below:

    White lines on screen that turn red at certain intervals for a short time, making these red lines deadly, destroying your ship if your core touches any part of the red line. The workings of an actual laser in-game is shown below:

- Doomsday Weapons

    Doomsday Weapons will be abbreviated to DD in this guide. DDL means Doomsday Lasers while DDMB means Doomsday Bomb.

- Doomsday Laser <img src="/terms/ddl.png" style={{zoom:0.3,verticalAlign:'middle'}}/>

    Doomsday lasers are strictly forward lasers that have the same width as a Nightfury laser. They generally have a very long reload time, and you can hear and see it's charging status when it is just about to fire. You can also see the region of space it will fire upon (it will start to have red glowing particles), and if you are in the way of it, your core will start to flash red at the upper half.

- Doomsday Bomb <img src="/terms/ddb.png" style={{zoom:0.3,verticalAlign:'middle'}}/>

    Doomsday Bombs release a very brief shockwave that will kill you if your core is caught in the radius without an invincibility option (such as Chrono Field or Personal Shield). They have a very long reload time, and you can hear and see it's charging status. You can see the radius of the Doomsday Bomb, which is equivalent to the radius of a level 1 Mega Bomb, clearly demarcated by a red border.

- Doomsday MIRV <img src="/terms/ddmirv.png" style={{zoom:0.35,verticalAlign:'middle'}}/>

    Doomsday MIRV will pop off MIRVs from nowhere around the turrets. When they charge, a red spot will appear on the screen. When they fire, rounds of MIRVs will appear in the red spots and fly forward. Unlike the normal MIRV, they can be activated as soon as they are fired.

- Darts

    Fast moving bullets that have a rounded front tip and 2 pointed edges behind.

- Pellets

    Slow moving bullets that look like elongated ovals.

- Shurikens

    Even slower moving bullets that are a darker shade of red on the exterior that always spin counter-clockwise as they move. Has 4 pointed edges around it.

- Boomerangs <img src="/terms/boomerang.png" style={{zoom:0.3,verticalAlign:'middle'}}/>

    The fastest bullets and the only type of bullets that moves in a curve rather than a straight line. And they literally look like a classic boomerang. The graphics of an actual boomerang in-game is shown below:

- MIRVs <img src="/terms/bmirv.png" style={{zoom:0.3,verticalAlign:'middle'}}/> <img src="/terms/lmirv.png" style={{zoom:0.3,verticalAlign:'middle'}}/>

    Nobody cares what they stand for (neither do I), but if you approach these slow moving (even slower than shurikens, although just very slightly so) yellow / gold rings that leave a flame-like trail behind it, at a certain threshold distance away from your ship's core, they explode. There are 2 types of MIRVs, one is the more common pellet MIRVs, which will explode into 30 pellets that are evenly spaced apart in 360° fashion. Each of the pellets continue to move radially outward from the point the MIRV explodes. The other less common type is laser MIRVs, which emits either 5 or 9 lasers equally spaced apart (in terms of angle) radially outward. They work just like a laser, having an initial period where the lines are white and don't destroy you, and later turning red which becomes dangerous, and finally fading away. Unless specified, MIRVs refer to pellet MIRVs.

- MIRV Deathonators (Caged MIRV) <img src="/terms/cmirv.png" style={{zoom:0.3,verticalAlign:'middle'}}/>

    Only equipped at the rear of Sparrows, these equipments (not exactly turrets) are harmless until the Sparrows are destroyed. In other words, they do not fire any MIRVs, bullets or lasers of any kind while the Sparrow (and the equipment) exists on field. However, once the Sparrow dies, the MIRV Deathonator activates and releases 30 pellets equally spaced out in a 360° fashion, same as the behaviour of a pellet MIRV when it detonates. There is no way to destroy the MIRV Deathonator without destroying the Sparrow, as they do not have any separate health. They also do not increase the health of the Sparrow.

- Launchers

    Launchers strictly fire bullets (not applicable to lasers) forward (or vertically downwards if you prefer).

- Spreads

    Spread turrets emit more than one lane of bullets (roughly straight and in-line) or lasers.


- Spinners

    Spinners emit bullets in all directions, even behind themselves.

- Tracking

    Tracking turrets will try to aim their guns (visually) such that they align themselves to the core of your ship.

- Bloomers

    These emit a burst of bullets (actually, only MIRVs) in all directions, forming a ring of them spreading radially outwards, below needing to reload for the next burst. It is similar to how a flower blooms when it opens up. This term is exclusively reserved for MIRVs because no other turrets behave this way, thus you will only hear of MIRV Bloomers.

- Tx (where x is an integer)

    Tier x. The same type of turret has different tiers, which can be easily distinguished by their appearance. A higher tier turret is more deadly and fires more bullets or lasers at once.

- Mk

    Mark. Even within the same tier of a specific turret, there are different attributes that define a turret. It varies what do the different Marks mean for different types of turrets. Generally, a higher Mark turret reloads faster, thus firing its next burst at shorter intervals. For lasers, a higher Mark also means the tracking is more accurate (it locks onto your ship's core much faster). It is impossible to tell apart the different Marks just by looking at the turret visually. Since it is impossible to tell apart the different Marks, this guide will only mention higher or lower Mk. (If you are confused, just think of Marks as categories within a single Tier, a higher Mark means a more dangerous category.)

## Auras

- BEMP <img src="/terms/bemp.png" style={{zoom:0.4,verticalAlign:'middle'}}/>

    Goliath Missile

- Blade Storm <img src="/terms/bs.png" style={{zoom:0.4,verticalAlign:'middle'}}/>

- Chrono Hop

    Refers to the technique where you can use the 0.5s of Phase Out time (after you leave the Chrono Field or when Chrono Field fades away) to cross a large region of bullets and/or lasers safely to re-position yourself in another part of the playing field.

## Zens

- Kappa <img src="/terms/kd.png" style={{zoom:0.4,verticalAlign:'middle'}}/>

    Kappa Drive

- Nightfury <img src="/terms/nf.png" style={{zoom:0.4,verticalAlign:'middle'}}/>

- Kappa Dodge

    Refers to the technique where you release your touch to use Kappa Drive in very small bursts, in order to slow time down and figure out the optimum way to pass in between tight gaps of bullets (and lasers if applicable). A small quick dash is made before you release you touch again to repeat the process until you are clear of a tight maze of bullets (and lasers, if applicable) in front of you. Primary purpose of this technique is for desperate survival, although because of Kappa Drive's ability to generate and attract particles and the close proximity to bullets and thus massive grazing, you can gain quite a lot of Aura from this technique as well. The video below shows this being used extensively:

## Miscellaneous

- AoE

    Area of Effect. Refers to Auras and Zens that either deal the same damage to all targets in range, or produce the same extent of a certain effect to anything that an Aura or Zen deals with. For example, a BEMP completely deletes the bullet the same way as any other bullet in range of its Aura.

- OP

    Overpowered

- RNG

    Random Number Generator. This term isn't used literally, it refers to the random aspects of the game, such as random invader movements which varies wildly between each game you play.

- Upfield

    Refers to the playing field at the top half of the screen
