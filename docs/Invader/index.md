# Invaders and Turrets

> That's something you combat with.

## Introduction

In the game, there are 7 types of invaders in 3 different affinities: Shielded, Armored, and Unprotected. The invaders from small to large are: Sparrow, Raven, Heron, Eagle, Vulture, Condor, and Roc.

The XP earned for killing each invader type is shown below. It is the same for all ranks, all leagues and all mission types. Note that when using revives, the invaders killed during the Act where you are unable to pass through are also counted.

| Invader | Exp  |
| ------- | ---- |
| Sparrow | 1    |
| Raven   | 6    |
| Heron   | 14   |
| Eagle   | 24   |
| Vulture | 60   |
| Condor  | 100  |
| Roc     | 180  |

The hitpoint of each type of invaders is the same, no matter which league you are in. Their hitpoints are as follows:

|         | Shielded | Shield+Hull | Armored | Hull |
| ------- | -------- | ----------- | ------- | ---- |
| Sparrow | 5        | 2+3         | 4       | 5    |
| Raven   | 31       | 13+18       | 24      | 27   |
| Heron   | 73       | 31+42       | 56      | 63   |
| Eagle   | 128      | 55+73       | 99      | 110  |
| Vulture | 315      | 135+180     | 243     | 270  |
| Condor  | 525      | 225+300     | 405     | 450  |
| Roc     | 945      | 405+540     | 729     | 810  |

## Turrets

Each invader will be equipped with several types of turrets. An annoying thing is that, there is distance where bullets continue to exist even as they exit your screen, and thus are able to deal damage to barriers that span beyond the screen. This distance is exactly 7, that is to say, bullets still exist within this distance (and may even fly back to screen!). 

Generally speaking, each type of turret is divided into 4 tiers. For some turrets, we have an additional tier 0 to differentiate them from tier 1 (since they usually have the appearance of tier 1 turrets but with weaker attacks). Each tier of turret has a different mark, the mark corresponds to the frequency and cooling time of the turret. The higher the mark, the lower the attack frequency and the shorter the cooling time.

Currently, there are 19 types of turrets in the game. The turrets are as follows:
