# Invaders and Turrets

> That's something you combat with.

## Introduction

In the game, there are 7 types of invaders in 3 different affinities: Shielded, Armored, and Unprotected. The invaders from small to large are: Sparrow, Raven, Heron, Eagle, Vulture, Condor, and Roc.

The hitpoint of each type of invaders is the same, no matter which league you are in. Their hitpoints are as follows:

|         | Shielded | Shield+Hull | Armored | Hull |
| ------- | -------- | ----------- | ------- | ---- |
| Sparrow | 5        | 2+3         | 4       | 5    |
| Raven   | 31       | 13+18       | 24      | 27   |
| Heron   | 73       | 31+42       | 56      | 63   |
| Eagle   | 128      | 55+73       | 99      | 110  |
| Vulture | 315      | 135+180     | 243     | 270  |
| Condor  | 525      | 225+300     | 405     | 450  |
| Roc     | 945      | 405+540     | 729     | 810  |

Each invader will be equipped with several types of turrets. An annoying thing is that, there is distance where bullets continue to exist even as they exit your screen, and thus are able to deal damage to barriers that span beyond the screen. This distance is exactly 7, that is to say, bullets still exist within this distance (and may even fly back to screen!). Currently, there are 18 types of turrets in the game. The turrets are as follows:

1. Pellet
