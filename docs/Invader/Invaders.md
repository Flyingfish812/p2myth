## Sparrow

The sparrow is the smallest invaders in the game. It moves very fast and it likes to get near your ship. It's also the biggest threat of the turret collision.

The sparrow is equipped with a fixed turret (which means it cannot turn around). Sometimes they may come in groups, and they serve as a good transition when you have to face a large amount of big invaders.

They can also be equipped with caged MIRVs, that means the MIRV (bullet only) will explode as soon as you kill the sparrow. Unless you are skilled enough, be sure to have a bullet-clearing skill with you.

## Raven

<img src="/Invader/armor_sinister_raven.jpg" style={{zoom:0.4}}/>
<img src="/Invader/hull_raven.jpg" style={{zoom:0.4}}/>

The raven is a small invader that equipped with 2 turrets. They may come in large amount, they may also give you big trouble of surviving.

Ravens can always give you quite a bit of energy. During missions it's important to store them if there are too many ravens.

It's easier to hit ravens than to hit sparrows, if you choose a ship that need accurate aim at invaders, please spend your main more on ravens than sparrows.

### Turret Types

- Mixed Turrets: (Speed) Laser Tracker (T1-T3), (Speed) Laser Shotgun (T1-T2), Pellet (T1-T4), Dart (T1-T3), Shuriken (Tide) (T1-T2), Boomerang (T1-T2), MIRV Launcher (T1-T2)

- Bullet Boomerang: Pellet (T1-T4), Dart (T1-T3), Shuriken (Tide) (T1-T2), Boomerang (T1-T2)

- Bullet Laser: (Speed) Laser Tracker (T1-T3), (Speed) Laser Shotgun (T1-T2), Pellet (T1-T4), Dart (T1-T3)

- MIRV Spam: MIRV Launcher (T1-T2)

- Laser Spam: (Speed) Laser Tracker (T1-T3), (Speed) Laser Shotgun (T1-T2)

## Heron

<img src="/Invader/shield_heron.jpg" style={{zoom:0.4}}/>
<img src="/Invader/shield_sinister_heron.jpg" style={{zoom:0.4}}/>
<img src="/Invader/armor_heron.jpg" style={{zoom:0.4}}/>
<img src="/Invader/armor_sinister_heron.jpg" style={{zoom:0.4}}/>
<img src="/Invader/hull_heron.jpg" style={{zoom:0.4}}/>

The heron is a mid-size invader that needs some effort to confront them. They cannot be killed simply by one main hit (except for some speedrun ships), neither by most of the AOE skills. When they come in groups and with lots of ravens, be careful and try to kill the smaller invaders first to gain energy.

Herons are equipped with 3 turrets, one in the middle fixed and two on the sides. They can be great threat to Mega Bomb ships because of the turret collision. Also, be sure that you still have energy to deal with other invaders even you need to face lots of herons.

### Turret Types

The turret in the middle is the same as that in sparrow, here I just list the side turrets.

- Mixed Turrets: (Speed) Laser Tracker (T1-T4), (Speed) Laser Shotgun (T1-T2), Pellet (T1-T4), Dart (T1-T3), Shuriken (Tide) (T1-T3), Boomerang (T1-T2), MIRV Launcher (T1-T2)

- Bullet Boomerang: Pellet (T1-T4), Dart (T1-T3), Shuriken (Tide) (T1-T3), Boomerang (T1-T2)

- Bullet Laser: (Speed) Laser Tracker (T1-T4), (Speed) Laser Shotgun (T1-T2), Pellet (T1-T4), Dart (T1-T3)

- MIRV Spam: MIRV Launcher (T1-T2)

- Laser Spam: (Speed) Laser Tracker (T1-T4), (Speed) Laser Shotgun (T1-T2)

- Laser Maze: (Speed) Laser Tracker (T1-T4), (Speed) Laser Shotgun (T1-T2)

- Bullet Hellspawn: Dart (T1-T3), Shuriken (Tide) (T1-T3)

- Boomerang Spam: Boomerang (T1-T2)

## Eagle

<img src="/Invader/shield_eagle.jpg" style={{zoom:0.4}}/>
<img src="/Invader/shield_sinister_eagle.jpg" style={{zoom:0.4}}/>
<img src="/Invader/armor_eagle.jpg" style={{zoom:0.4}}/>
<img src="/Invader/armor_sinister_eagle.jpg" style={{zoom:0.4}}/>
<img src="/Invader/hull_eagle.jpg" style={{zoom:0.4}}/>

Eagles are mid-size invaders with 3 turrets, they are bigger than herons. They have high hitpoints so they can give you great trouble. If they come alone, they will always be accompanied with lots of small invaders. In the later acts, they will also come in 2~4 in a wave.

If 2 eagles come in a row, it's frequent that they will separate away and leave a gap in between. This is the most threatening case, because you have to face attacks from both left and right. In this case, one choice is to kill them immediately by 3 vorpal lances before they separate, another choice is to use Mega Bomb's Fusion Core, otherwise, quit and start a new game is not a bad choice.

In general, eagles will cost you lots of energy and they can return less. Be sure to store your energy if you need to face groups of eagles, or you will have to pray for your main weapon to be efficient enough.

### Turret Types

The turrets in the middle have more choices than the side ones. They will be noted in italic.

## Vulture

<img src="/Invader/shield_vulture.jpg" style={{zoom:0.4}}/>
<img src="/Invader/shield_sinister_vulture.jpg" style={{zoom:0.4}}/>
<img src="/Invader/armor_vulture.jpg" style={{zoom:0.4}}/>
<img src="/Invader/armor_sinister_vulture.jpg" style={{zoom:0.4}}/>
<img src="/Invader/hull_vulture.jpg" style={{zoom:0.4}}/>

Vulture are big invaders with 4 turrets. They do not move a lot. In the waves they may come front or back. If they come front, they will be followed by groups of ravens (sparrows) or 2 eagles. If they come front, they always come along with a big welcome party of sparrows, ravens, herons, and eagles.

Most of the times you can serve the vulture as a small boss, because they are heavy ones and they can be equipped with doomsday weapons. For some waves, you may find it easier to kill the vulture at the back than kill the welcome party first. That depends on the turrets.

### Turret Types

All type of turrets are available for vulture. If not mentioned, all the turrets should be considered as T1-T4.

## Condor

<img src="/Invader/shield_sinister_condor.jpg" style={{zoom:0.4}}/>
<img src="/Invader/armor_condor.jpg" style={{zoom:0.4}}/>
<img src="/Invader/armor_sinister_condor.jpg" style={{zoom:0.4}}/>
<img src="/Invader/hull_condor.jpg" style={{zoom:0.4}}/>

Condor is a tough invader with 6 turrets. They can occupy half of your screen. When they come front, there will be 4 ravens at the back. When they come back, you may find any kind of welcome party with smaller invaders.

Condors need huge amount of energy. Since you may have several condors in one mission, you have to decide a strategy for all the condors you will meet. They can give you energy enough for one full aura, but it's hard to obtain them at once.

## Roc

<img src="/Invader/armor_roc.jpg" style={{zoom:0.4}}/>
<img src="/Invader/armor_sinister_roc.jpg" style={{zoom:0.4}}/>
<img src="/Invader/hull_roc.jpg" style={{zoom:0.4}}/>

Roc is the hardest boss in the game, and it's the only invader that needs 8 seconds to be deployed. A roc hardly move, and it can only come at back. Its welcome party may vary from none to lots of small invaders.

Previously, roc may only appear in the last wave as the final boss. In the current version, roc can appear in any wave of act 5. When you have to confront a roc, be sure to have enough energy and have a good strategy. If it's not the final wave, be sure you are safe to finish the rest waves.

All type of turrets are available for roc. If not mentioned, all the turrets should be considered as T1-T4.
