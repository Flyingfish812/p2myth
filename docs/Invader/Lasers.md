- Tier 1 (Figure 1): The turning speed is extremely slow. After 3 seconds of charging, a laser shot is fired in the aiming direction that lasts for 1 second.
- Tier 2 (Figure 2): The turning speed is slow. After 3 seconds of charging, a laser shot is fired in the aiming direction that lasts for 1 second.
- Tier 3 (Figure 3): The turning speed is medium. After 3 seconds of charging, 2 laser shots are fired in the aiming direction that lasts for 1 second.
- Tier 4 (Figure 4): The turning speed is fast. After 3 seconds of charging, 3 laser shots are fired in the aiming direction that lasts for 1 second.

## Tiers and Patterns - Speed Laser

- Tier 1 (Figure 1): The turning speed is extremely slow. After 1 second of charging, it shoots a laser shot in the aiming direction that lasts for 0.5 seconds.
- Tier 2 (Figure 2): The turning speed is slow. After 1 second of charging, it shoots a laser shot in the aiming direction that lasts for 0.5 seconds.
- Tier 3 (Figure 3): The turning speed is medium. After 1 second of charging, 2 laser shots are fired in the aiming direction, in the order of right → left, lasting for 0.5 seconds.
- Tier 4 (Figure 4): The turning speed is fast. After 1 second of charging, 3 laser shots are fired in the aiming direction, in the order of right → left → center, lasting 0.5 seconds.

Speed Laser is a very troublesome turret. Unlike ordinary tracking lasers, speed lasers will not charge immediately when entering the field. Instead, like dart turrets, they will not start charging until your core appears within the fan-shaped range in front of it. Another difference is that the speed laser does not move when firing, which means that you cannot stand still between two lasers like a normal tier 3 tracking laser, because the movement of the turret will cause the laser to sweep across your core.

There are many ways to deal with them. Since they need their core to appear in the fan-shaped range in front of them to charge up, we can fly from one side to the other at the bottom to activate all the speed lasers at the beginning. You can also try to prioritize popping the speed lasers, which will save you a lot of trouble. If you are lucky, the speed laser will just miss you while you are standing still, this method is not recommended because it relies on a lot of luck. For example, when a tier 3 speed laser is aimed at you and the invader moves to the left, you can stand on the left laser first, wait for the right laser to finish shooting, and then slowly move to the right to avoid the left laser.

The most annoying situation is when it is mixed with bullets. Since the speed laser is an instant attack, unlike the bullets flying forward, this will make it impossible for you to dodge and graze the bullets. At this time, you must give priority to popping the speed laser in the back row.
