# Lasers

> A linear offensive weapon, its characteristic is to catch you off guard.

There are 3 types of laser turrets, spread, tracking, and speed laser.

## Tiers and Patterns - Laser Spread (Shotgun)

- Tier 1 (Figure 1): After 3 seconds of charging, it will shoot continuously in 3 directions for 1 second.
- Tier 2 (Figure 2): After 3 seconds of charging, it will shoot continuously in 5 directions for 1 second.
- Tier 3 (Figure 3): After 3 seconds of charging, it will shoot continuously in 7 directions for 1 second.
- Tier 4 (Figure 4): After 3 seconds of charging, it will shoot continuously in 9 directions for 1 second.

Spread turrets are annoying turrets to deal with you can only every hope to follow between their laser streams, especially for Ravens. There is generally no way against laser spread turrets other than to eliminate the invaders carrying such laser spread turrets quickly. In Vultures and above however, spread lasers are less of a threat due to their minimal movement and you should focus on eliminating another more dangerous turret first (if any). Eagles are not too much of a threat with them unless they are behind (which is rare), but if so...well, good luck, because such waves are one of the hardest to deal with. No matter whether you are speedrunning or not, spread turrets on smaller invaders are to be gotten rid of as soon as possible.

PS is obviously the best defence against lasers, as you can simply sit still just before the lasers are about to fire and the invaders will start to self harm from the Laser Reflection of PS ult. The next best defence is TP since you can TP away before the lasers fire to a safe corner and need not contend with all the other bullets on field. However, when the field has many different laser tracking turrets of different Mks, TP starts to suffer against dealing with the different firing times of the tracking after the initial laser burst. The next defence, mediocre at best, is BEMP where firing off a BEMP can reset the lasers, usually useful after the first burst of lasers where lasers start to fire off sync. It should of course, be still used in the first burst of lasers if you are unable to strafe. The reset helps to buy you some time, however, it will not last for long.

PD is a rather bad defence against lasers, but still helps when you are strafing to avoid lasers, but be careful to not strafe too fast as PD can't clear so many bullets at once. Barriers are generally a bad defence against lasers as barriers take increased damage against lasers, so they don't last very long. Furthermore, the Phase Out of barriers is unreliable in protecting you from lasers. However, the smallest barriers will always last against one full burst of lasers if deployed right before the lasers fire, which can work in your favor at times. Phalanx is also horrible against lasers as they break near instantly and there is not enough response time to deploy a new Phalanx, resulting in you spamming Phalanxes and thus wasting many of its charges.

## Tiers and Patterns - Laser Tracker

- Tier 1 (Figure 1): The turning speed is extremely slow. After 3 seconds of charging, a laser shot is fired in the aiming direction that lasts for 1 second.
- Tier 2 (Figure 2): The turning speed is slow. After 3 seconds of charging, a laser shot is fired in the aiming direction that lasts for 1 second.
- Tier 3 (Figure 3): The turning speed is medium. After 3 seconds of charging, 2 laser shots are fired in the aiming direction that lasts for 1 second.
- Tier 4 (Figure 4): The turning speed is fast. After 3 seconds of charging, 3 laser shots are fired in the aiming direction that lasts for 1 second.

Laser tracking turrets are less annoying, strangely. The general tactic for tracking lasers is to lure them to one side of the field, and then quickly strafe to the other side of the field (or less, such as to the center of the field if the tracking is slow). T1 turrets are only of some threat unless they are of high Mk which track you quite fast, otherwise, they are easy to deal with and you generally need not care about eliminating these turrets fast. T4 tracking laser turrets on the other hand, often track fast and is almost always the first priority of elimination.

T3 tracking laser turrets are the most special cases. You can in fact, sit completely still and survive, a very little known fact about T3 tracking lasers. This is because the spacing between lasers are just enough to go through your core, with some allowance as well. However, be careful of Ravens equipped with these T3 lasers, as their rapid movement can throw their perfect lock-on off and kill you instead. Generally, do not use this technique for Ravens with T3 lasers at the front of the wave, but those at the back of the wave are generally fine unless they are of low Mk, and it is obvious that they track very slowly. For Herons and above, it is generally fine to sit still. In fact, for Herons with high Mk T3 lasers, or Vultures and above with such T3 lasers, you can still inch your way, albeit very slowly, to avoid other bullets such as pellets or darts. This technique is very useful especially against high Mk T3 lasers where it is very difficult to avoid by making a last minute strafe. It is also very useful against Condors and Rocs, where particles are scarce, and using this technique allows for massive grazing and thus refills your Aura quickly.

## Tiers and Patterns - Speed Laser

- Tier 1 (Figure 1): The turning speed is extremely slow. After 1 second of charging, it shoots a laser shot in the aiming direction that lasts for 0.5 seconds.
- Tier 2 (Figure 2): The turning speed is slow. After 1 second of charging, it shoots a laser shot in the aiming direction that lasts for 0.5 seconds.
- Tier 3 (Figure 3): The turning speed is medium. After 1 second of charging, 2 laser shots are fired in the aiming direction, in the order of right → left, lasting for 0.5 seconds.
- Tier 4 (Figure 4): The turning speed is fast. After 1 second of charging, 3 laser shots are fired in the aiming direction, in the order of right → left → center, lasting 0.5 seconds.

Speed Laser is a very troublesome turret. Unlike ordinary tracking lasers, speed lasers will not charge immediately when entering the field. Instead, like dart turrets, they will not start charging until your core appears within the fan-shaped range in front of it. Another difference is that the speed laser does not move when firing, which means that you cannot stand still between two lasers like a normal tier 3 tracking laser, because the movement of the turret will cause the laser to sweep across your core.

There are many ways to deal with them. Since they need their core to appear in the fan-shaped range in front of them to charge up, we can fly from one side to the other at the bottom to activate all the speed lasers at the beginning. You can also try to prioritize popping the speed lasers, which will save you a lot of trouble. If you are lucky, the speed laser will just miss you while you are standing still, this method is not recommended because it relies on a lot of luck. For example, when a tier 3 speed laser is aimed at you and the invader moves to the left, you can stand on the left laser first, wait for the right laser to finish shooting, and then slowly move to the right to avoid the left laser.

The most annoying situation is when it is mixed with bullets. Since the speed laser is an instant attack, unlike the bullets flying forward, this will make it impossible for you to dodge and graze the bullets. At this time, you must give priority to popping the speed laser in the back row.
