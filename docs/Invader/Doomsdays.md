> Wide-range attack leaving you unable to hide (?)

## Introduction

The Doomsday weapons are a series of wide-range attack weapons that will bring you different forms of threats. Generally speaking, if you encounter these turrets during a mission, it's best to pop them first (sometimes there is no need to pop them first, I will explain why).

## Doomsday Bomb

- Assault Pattern: Create a red area with a range of 300, which will explode after 3 seconds of charging, impacting you within the range.

Doomsday Bomb is a wide-range bomb that creates a explosion of radius 300. You will not find DDMBs appearing in bronze ranks.

## Doomsday Laser

- Assaulting Pattern: Create a wide red strip area with a width of 100. After 3 seconds of charging, the laser will shoot for 3 seconds.

An interesting thing about DDL is it can be "delayed" slightly by the Nightfury, since Nightfury will neutralize the DDL. However, since DDL lasts much longer than a Nightfury, you will still get killed unless you move out of the way as Nightfury fires. Using the Nightfury to neutralize a DDL is a very bad idea since you will waste all if not most of the 300 damage of the Nightfury. This feature is simply included for fun as stated by the devs, and is not a viable strategy. This feature was added in v5.0.3 as a fun feature. The left GIF shows how the attempted but failed battle between the DDL and Nightfury (before the v5.0.3 update) while the right GIF shows the actual epic battle between the DDL and Nightfury (after the v5.0.3 update).

- 天尘座: Please buy Mirage and battle DDL with Nightfury.

## Doomsday MIRV

- Assaulting Pattern: Create multiple circles (in 3 to 5 circles according to the level) of red points (about 14) around it. After 3 seconds of charging, a forward-flying MIRV will be generated out of thin air at the red light point.

Doomsday MIRV pose the greatest threat, not only covering the entire screen, but even forcing you to explode at least one row of MIRVs. This will result in a lot of bullets appearing on the scene, making your dodging very difficult.

Traditional bullet-clearing skills are still the best way to deal with MIRVs, but the MIRVs by Doomsday MIRV will bring a new problem. If you are using a ult-level Bullet EMP, due to its property of resetting the turret, it is likely to cause the turret's reset. The result is that you will have to face the screen full of MIRV attacks twice in a row. Therefore, the best way is to prioritize the popping of the Doomsday MIRVs, which pose a significantly greater threat than the others. Secondly, if you don't have a good way to pop it immediately, you should use some skill that won't cause it to reset, such as Reflex EMP or Point Defense.

Unlike ordinary MIRVs, the MIRVs released by Doomsday MIRV do not have a flight time of 0.4 seconds and will explode immediately as long as you get close. If you're unlucky and have to clear the mission using some ships with no defensive skills, I've got some suggestions here. If you are using survival ships, you can choose to activate the MIRVs in the two rows first, and then retreat to the back row to dodge them slowly. If you are using a speedrun ship, try to pop the turret first instead of maximizing the output, unless you can directly kill the invader (such as vulture).

Note: It is not recommended to graze the Doomsday MIRV. This skill puts forward very high requirements on timing and positioning, and is useless in most cases (pop them first is usually a better choice). If you don't listen to me and insist on grazing them, you can check the Shogun's Cookbook for detailed study.

- 圆锥曲线: I'd like Doomsday Laser MIRV.

## Doomsday Super MIRV

- Assaulting Pattern: After 3 seconds of *quiet* charging, four **huge** MIRVs will be launched one by one. As you get closer, the huge MIRV will split into multiple smaller MIRVs (14 MIRVs), which will further explode with massive amounts of bullets.

Although the name is "Super MIRV", its threat is not as terrifying as imagined. The strategy is much simpler than the ordinary Doomsday MIRV.

Its characteristic is a very huge MIRV bomb. When there are not too many bullets, you can use any method you like to tease it. Unlike normal MIRV, super MIRVs do not have a flight time of 0.4 seconds and can be activated the moment they are generated. In other words, if you get very close, you can think it as a slightly weaker level-3 MIRV bloomer.

Super MIRV cannot be instantly eliminated by ult-level point defense, but it can be eliminated by other bullet-clearing skills, including teleport.

It should be noted that if you leave the super MIRV alone, you'd better leave it alone and let it fly away. Otherwise, when it explodes in the lower part of the screen, it will be equivalent to a MIRV bloomer close to your face, which is a very dangerous situation. If there is such a super MIRV in a wave of invader attacks, it is a good choice to give priority to activate it.

*Trivia: Doomsday MIRV's appearance is different from Doomsday Super MIRV. In particular, the sliders are facing exterior for DDM, while interior for DDSM:*
