# Acknowledgement

The reconstruction project started on January 29, 2024, and we are currently stepping up efforts to reconstruct the content of various sections of the site. There are many players who have provided us with great help during the site reconstruction process. As the person in charge of the site, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to these players.
