## Website Updates

Here we present to you some of the process of establishing this site.

1. Phase I (2021-10)

    Active players in the Myth community group spontaneously organized the Phoenix 2 illustrated book building project. The p2myth.club website was established, focusing on information query, including ship and skill information.

2. Phase II (2022-3)

    The translation of the English version of the website has been launched, and all content on the website has both Chinese and English versions.

3. Phase III (2023-11)

    After a long period of silence, the website launched a content renovation plan to update the outdated content on the website and add new content.

4. Phase IV (2024-1)

    Due to server issues, all the content of the original website was lost, and only partial backups were retained, so a reconstruction plan was launched. The current website is exactly the reconstructed architecture.

Due to the heavy workload of reconstruction, the proofreading of the content requires the help of all players who come to this site. If you have a better way of writing a certain paragraph of content, don't hesitate to inform the administrator of this site to make changes.
