# Mistral

> We often overestimate its strength, but we can never underestimate its potential.

Author: Flyingfish812

## Intro

Mistral was actually not very popular when it first came out. Its skill combination is Goliath missiles and Mega Bomb. Both AOE skills cause residual health. Therefore its speedrun potential is not very outstanding. In fact, if its two APEXes weren't so dazzling, it might not have been noticed at all.

Its main fires a laser forward at fixed intervals. Since it is an Armor-Piercing weapon and has no critical hits, it will cause fixed damage to any type of invader. This eliminates the need for Mistral to consider critical hits when speedrunning. In other words, as long as the your strategy is correct, the final score only depends on whether the invaders are well gathered, and the problem of gathering can be avoided through the combination of skills.

## Basics

### Main

Mistral's main is not an easy one to master. It looks like a simple shot, but in fact it requires you to pay attention to the location of the invaders at all times. The first stage of learning the main is to **accurately hit the target** you want to shoot, and the second stage is to be able to skillfully use the main to sweep.

The first stage is a basic training of Mistral, which only requires you to aim at the target when the main is fired. Practicing this basic skill will help you efficiently pop the turrets of heavy invaders, and will also help you better master the sweeping of the main gun.

Unlike Wraith, Mistral's main can only kill up to two Sparrows at a time, and that's when invaders are very close. At this time, you need to grasp the firing frequency of the main. Generally speaking, when your main is fired, you should move in the direction of the other sparrow at the same time to ensure that you can shoot both sparrows exactly.

As shown in the picture below, if the sparrows are too far apart, there is no need to force multiple shots. Instead, ensure that the sparrow targeted at the beginning is killed. When the sparrows gather together, you need to control the movement to catch them all:

### Goliath Missile

The principle of using Goliath missiles is simple: let each missile fully exert its AOE damage.

The damage of the missile is 10 impact damage + 24 AOE damage. An AOE of 24 means that ravens (hull with 27 hp) will still have a little health (except for the Centurion's Armor-Piercing missiles against armored ravens). So in a wave of attacks, if you only use one missile, you need to make sure the missile covers as many invaders as possible.

Here are some common usage locations for single-shot missiles:

Since one missile will not kill ravens, which needs to be killed by the main, there is a second way to play, which is to use two missiles together. You can use one missile to clear the left half and another to clear the right half; You can also choose to hit both missiles in the middle, causing more damage to the heavier invader through an additional 10 impact damage, while using 2 AOE damage destroys surrounding ravens.

The figure below shows the use of two missiles to clear half of an area:

<img src="/Cookbook/mistral5.gif" style={{zoom:0.5}}/>

And hit the middle together:

<img src="/Cookbook/mistral6.gif" style={{zoom:0.5}}/>

Or more precisely, one for the back row and the other for the front row:

<img src="/Cookbook/mistral7.gif" style={{zoom:0.5}}/>

The eagles are a little more troublesome, if you want to kill 2 eagles at the same time, you need 4 missiles. Generally speaking, the distribution is 2 missiles on the left and right. The reason eagles are troublesome is that just two eagles can use up our missiles, so unless there is no time for a Mega Bomb, avoid using large numbers of Goliath missiles to kill eagles.

In a helpless situation, it is best to ensure that the AOE damage of the missile is not wasted, **especially avoid that the missile on the left does not hit the medium on the right**. The picture below is a usage example:

<img src="/Cookbook/mistral8.gif" style={{zoom:0.5}}/>

The techniques for Goliath missiles alone are almost here. More techniques for using them will be introduced in the next part of combo techniques.

### Mega Bomb

The use of Mega Bombs is the same as that of other ships. The priority is to choose areas with a higher density of invaders to fully utilize the 40 damage of fusion core. For example, in a wave composed mostly of ravens, the priority spot is given to the location between two herons; In a wave with 2 or 4 eagles, the location in the middle of eagles is selected. When the invaders are converging, you even need to bet that the fusion core can cover more than 3 heavy invaders.

The most important thing is the timing of using the bomb. It is usually used at the beginning of a wave rather than in the middle of a wave. Sometimes, if you find that a wave of invaders is a dense group of ravens and sparrows, you can charge bombs even if it is not the first wave of an act:

Mastering the above points, the use of Mega Bomb will become easier and easier.

### Combo skills

Both Goliath missiles and Mega Bomb will produce a considerable number of invaders with little health, which is a disadvantage for each of the two skills. But you can also say that these two skills have a complementary relationship in one way or another. In this section we will introduce some common techniques for combining them.

#### Charge After Missile

One disadvantage of Mega Bomb is that the charging time is too long. Frequent use will cause unablility to recharge. Especially when confronting a wave of dense invaders, Mega Bomb is a very effective tool to reduce pressure.

The feature of the Goliath missile is its slow flight speed. We can use this feature to cooperate with the charging of the Mega Bomb to gain sufficient charging time.

There are many scenarios for its use, such as when you need to charge for a wave of dense invaders in the middle of an act. Usually this requires you to calculate the remaining HP of the invader and ensure that one missile can destroy the remaining invader. **Be sure to aim accurately, as the invader may have already moved aside when the missile arrives**.

Taking a vulture (hull) as an example, 270 HP = fusion core + 11 main attacks + 1 Goliath missile. Therefore, our strategy is obvious. When the Mega Bomb is used, count the number of hits from the main. While counting to 11, throw the Goliath missile and fly up to charge the bomb.

#### Focus Fire

Focusing fire means allocating the impact damage of Goliath missiles to heavy invaders as much as possible, such as vulture and Condor, while using the AOE damage of Mega Bomb and Goliath missile on the small ones in the front row.

In this case, the main should also hit more on heavy invaders, and only do last hits when the AOE damage is not enough.

## Advanced

The advanced part mainly introduces Mistral's two APEX skills: Fast Charge and Disintegrator Warhead. These two APEXes allow Mistral to exert different advantages in different mission types.

### Fast Charge

Fast Charge is designed to unleash the full potential of Mega Bomb, saving the use of Goliath missiles with more AOE damage.

It can be said that the Fast Charge has changed the rules of using Mega Bomb. For example, Mega Bomb are charged and used in the first wave or when there are dense invaders. Fast charging allows you to use bombs in 2 closely connected waves of invaders. As shown in the picture below, the first three waves of the first act were solved with Mega Bomb, main, and a Goliath missile respectively. The 4th wave can even use another bomb (continue to be used in 2-1):

The following is an application in 3-4:

<img src="/Cookbook/mistral12.gif" style={{zoom:0.5}}/>

This skill is very effective when your missiles are insufficient. If it is a base Mega Bomb, you will not have enough charging time when facing darts. Fast Charge gives you the ability to race against darts, and you can bet you're faster than them. This small possibility can bring you huge improvements.

In the figure below, we demonstrate two examples of dart races (a narrow death):

More extremely:

As you should have discovered, Fast Charge fully activates Mistral's potential. More Mega Bombs mean that Goliath missiles can be used more concentratedly to a certain wave of invaders.

### Disintegrator Warhead

As the name suggests (?), this APEX allows the Goliath missile to eliminate bullets in an area as soon as it explodes. In other words, even in dense bullet, Mistral has a good ability to survive.

Dense bullet means you need more missiles to clear the bullet. Obviously, more energy requires more graze. One of the most *famous* sources of graze is caged MIRV. Each caged MIRV can provide 30 bullets of energy, which is enough to charge a Goliath missile. Therefore, this APEX needs to be used in missions with caged MIRV to play a stronger advantage than the Fast Charge APEX.

> If there is no caged MIRV, just dodge the bullets.

#### Mega Bomb Graze

If you come to practice this skill, you must have heard more or less about the method of grazing a caged MIRV by Mega Bomb. For those players who haven't had time to read the relevant content, we will repeat the method of this skill again.

Using a Mega Bomb to graze usually occurs in the first wave of each act. First, you need to throw your ship to the top of the screen at the beginning, usually higher than a caged-MIRV sparrow, and then charge up the Mega Bomb.

When the bomb is fully charged, aim your ship **toward the edge of the self-exploding bomb** and pull it hard. At this time, the core of your ship should just pass by the exploding MIRV. Since it just exploded and has not dispersed, you should be able to graze all the bullets. Then one missile is charged. As shown below:

<img src="/Cookbook/mistral1.png" style={{zoom:0.5}}/>

A missile gained by grazing should be **used immediately** in the next wave, otherwise you will have to do some dodging, which will reduce your performance. For example, a complete wave of grazing and using missiles is as follows:

<img src="/Cookbook/mistral2.gif" style={{zoom:0.5}}/>

#### Double Graze

The practice of Double Graze is similar to that of Single Mega Bomb Graze, except that two missiles are charged at one time.

In missions, sometimes two sparrows will appear in the same straight line. Since the process of **Mega Bomb** and **Grazing** are **both** a top-down process, as long as your speed is fast enough, you can wipe two caged MIRV at the same time, and then get two Goliath missile. Don't underestimate this skill. It not only provides you with higher damage, but also clears an area for you.

The improvement of Disintegrator Warhead is to make full use of any bullets fired by the invaders, convert them into our energy and then do a beautiful counterattack.
