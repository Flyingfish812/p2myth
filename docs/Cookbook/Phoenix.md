# Phoenix

> The ship on the front cover, defense is offense, and vice versa.

Author: Flyingfish812

## Introduction

As the most populated ship in this game, the Phoenix performs exceptionally well in all aspects. Its defense, combining Bullet EMP with Personal Shield, provides corresponding defensive measures against both bullets and lasers. In terms of offense, the main weapon continuously fires forward to offer stable output. In laser missions, the Personal Shield's laser reflection serves as assistance, and the Delta APEX provides an additional 10 AOE damage for Bullet EMP, diversifying its offensive capabilities. In summary, it can serve as both an offensive output and survival-oriented ship, making it a versatile choice.

Some key skills of the Phoenix are not as complex as other ships; you need to focus on details in speedrun. Typically, the Phoenix excels in shielded laser spam missions for speedrun. In such missions, there are numerous lasers, and making effective use of shield reflection can simplify and ease the mission. Furthermore, we believe that learning some small tricks can significantly enhance your gaming experience.

This guide does not differentiate between basic and advanced sessions. Additionally, since speedrun ability heavily relies on the destructive wave of Bullet EMP, all content will be based on the Delta Phoenix.

## Main Weapon

As a main weapon that continuously fires forward, the Phoenix can certainly unleash a small burst at the beginning of each wave by prefiring the main weapon. This technique can be said to be **repeatedly used** throughout the missions. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced player, be sure to fully utilize this feature as it is an important technique for relieving your pressure.

Although the implementation of this technique is very simple, whether you use it or not can make a difference of close to one second. Therefore, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with all the configurations of this level in advance when speedrunning with the Phoenix, and prefire at the appropriate positions (left, center, right).

### Keys for Prefire

Prefiring must be done at the bottom of the screen. Before a wave begins, you need to position yourself at the bottom of the screen, wait for the invaders to come, then sprint forward to unleash a large amount of damage at once. Typically, by this time, the invaders' shields have already been broken, allowing other skills (including Destructive Wave, Laser Reflection) to follow suit.

For example, in the first act dominated by sparrows' attacks, you can use this technique:

You can use prefire to instantly deal with a row of sparrows formed in a square formation. Typically, the prefired shots are sufficient to eliminate two sparrows completely, so as soon as the invaders come, you can move towards the other side to eliminate the remaining sparrows. This greatly saves your number of actions.

This skill is widely used from sparrows and ravens:

to the rocs:

<img src="/PhoenixCB/phoenix12.png" style={{zoom:0.25}}/>

You can always fully use the prefiring. This skill can even have a decisive change, we will describe it later.

## Destructive Wave

As one of the most powerful skills of the Bullet EMP (the other being Bullet Detonator), Destructive Wave plays an extremely powerful role in Phoenix's speedrun. Its key points are also very simple, thus it needs to be fully utilized throughout the game.

The maximum damage of Destructive Wave is 10, meaning it can kill a swarm of sparrows. At the same time, it does not have a 2.5 times damage against shields. Therefore, during usage, unless there are specific requirements, you should first break the invaders' shields before using the Bullet EMP to maximize the output efficiency of the main weapon and aura combination.

### Break Shield First

The benefit of prioritizing the use of the main weapon to break shields is that it fully utilizes the 2.5 times damage against shields. Therefore, even though invaders may have shields equivalent to 75% of their health, breaking the shields is a matter of a few shots for the main weapon. Thus, the first point to note when using Destructive Wave is to **break shields before using the aura**.

Typically, a wave of attacks will feature a large number of ravens. Your first task is to break the shields of each invader one by one. However, this operation leads to a problem: sequentially breaking shields consumes a significant amount of player actions. Even if you painstakingly break the shields of all invaders and finally have the opportunity to use Destructive Wave, almost all invaders will be left with low health afterward. At this point, the invaders' laser charge resets, and you have no energy left, meaning you have to repeat the process to finish off the remaining invaders. This excessive number of actions is highly detrimental to speedrun.

You've probably realized the solution: simply use the main weapon to reduce invaders' health to just enough for a Destructive Wave at the beginning of shield breaking. Yes, this is the second key point of using Destructive Wave: **lower invaders' health to the kill line** as much as possible before using Destructive Wave to finish them off at once.

Let's demonstrate with an example: in this wave of attack, there are a total of 5 ravens. Before using Destructive Wave, our goal is to reduce the health of all ravens as much as possible, then eliminate them all with one Destructive Wave:

Of course, implementing the second point is very challenging because you need to have a rough idea of how much output time is required to lower the health to the desired level, which falls into the realm of muscle memory. Therefore, a plan B is, if you are unsure whether the health has been lowered enough, you can skip those invaders grouped together, even if you have to follow up with additional shots, it won't waste much movement of the main weapon.

### Sparrow's Dilemma

This is a dilemma to consider when energy is insufficient: whether to use the main weapon or Destructive Wave to eliminate the sparrows? The answer to this question varies from person to person.

For example, suppose in both waves 1-3 and 1-4, there is a setup of one raven with four sparrows. Your energy is not sufficient to eliminate the sparrows with two Destructive Waves consecutively. You can choose to conserve energy by focusing on the raven first to absorb some energy before finishing off the sparrows, or you can choose to use the main weapon in the first wave and then freely use Destructive Wave in the second wave.

<img src="/PhoenixCB/phoenix2-3.png" style={{zoom:0.25}}/>

By the way, in most cases, the latter solution is more efficient because the former one requires a high level of precision in energy control, making it easy for you to make mistakes. When using the latter solution, you can fully utilize the prefire technique we mentioned earlier to prioritize eliminating two ravens first, then focus on dealing with the remaining invaders.

### Grazing

It's not to say that focusing on defense means you don't need to graze bullets. If the bullet patterns are very dense but slow-moving, you can absolutely utilize the abundance of energy and convert it into your own output. This is a point that players often overlook while playing.

## Laser Reflection

The highlight of the Phoenix is the laser reflection, which directly determines the success or failure of the performance.

First, let's review the key points of laser reflection. The damage caused by shield-reflected lasers is 10 per second, and when reflecting, a random invader position is selected to reflect the laser. The laser will disappear once the target is eliminated.

The last point to note here is that the reflected laser will disappear after the invader is eliminated. In other words, you need to avoid reflecting lasers from large invaders or laser patterns onto the sparrows as much as possible.

### Front Reflection

Most of the invader's lasers are directed forward, so front reflection is the most commonly used method.

If the invader's weapons consist mainly of tracking lasers, you should try to position yourself at the bottom of the screen so that all lasers target you. At the moment when the lasers begin to charge, activate the shield to reflect all of them.

The handling of MIRV Bloomer, which is also the most common configuration in the Laser Spam level, will be the focus of this section.

1. MIRV Bloomer Only

    This is the most basic configuration, usually found on vultures. Vultures typically come equipped with two MIRV Bloomers, providing enough lasers to destroy all invaders on the field. Therefore, your strategy is quite straightforward: you don't need to use any destructive waves, just wait for the Laser MIRVs to activate and then shield reflect.

    <img src="/PhoenixCB/phoenix9.png" style={{zoom:0.25}}/>

    In addition, there's a small detail. Before each laser is fired, there will be a white pulse, which can be grazed. In other words, grazing as many pulses as possible before activating the shield can restore a portion of the aura. The extra energy obtained can make you more comfortable in the next wave.

    Like this:

    <img src="/PhoenixCB/phoenix22.gif" style={{zoom:1}}/>

2. MIRV Bloomer + Shuriken Tide

    This configuration is more common on eagles. The way to deal with it is to get as close as possible to more MIRVs and then activate them:

    <img src="/PhoenixCB/phoenix6.png" style={{zoom:0.25}}/>
    
    And use Bullet EMP to clear the redundants including bullets and sparrows around.

    <img src="/PhoenixCB/phoenix7.png" style={{zoom:0.25}}/>
    
    It is important to note that using Destructive Waves is essential. Not only does it help you find the right reflection position, but it also timely eliminates potential threats that could cause overflow damage. This is because lasers disappear after destroying enemies, so if a large number of lasers are only used to destroy small invaders, it means large invader ships won't receive enough damage, which is equally fatal.

3. Roc

    The strategy for dealing with the Roc is often overlooked by most players because they usually think that one reflection is enough to destroy it. However, the Roc has very thick health. If the reflection position chosen is not appropriate, additional main cannon output may be needed to compensate.

    <img src="/PhoenixCB/phoenix12.png" style={{zoom:0.25}}/>

    The initial move against the Roc must be to prefire at the bottom, this is to reduce the Roc's health to provide greater margin of error. Through a simple calculation, it can be found that a Roc with 945 health under laser reflection of 10 damage per second, requires 95 lasers to be completely destroyed (the laser's duration is only 1 second). However, the maximum number of lasers that a laser MIRV can provide is 9, meaning your shield must cover as many lasers as possible. In fact, if there are only 20-30 lasers on the field, it already densely covers the entire screen, and your naked eye cannot judge whether there are 90 lasers. From this point of view, the initial **prefire is necessary**.

    Sometimes, waves from the sides are easily blocking your path, so front reflection is not a good idea. Here we provide a small trick: dive to the middle position between the two MIRV Bloomers for reflection. It is worth noting that the laser MIRVs themselves have collision detection, and you need to accurately avoid them to activate shield reflection (otherwise, the reflected laser count will be insufficient). A safe position is the middle position pointed to by the tips of the two MIRV Bloomers, which happens to be between the two adjacent laser MIRVs, helping you avoid collision detection:

    <img src="/PhoenixCB/phoenix12b.png" style={{zoom:0.5}}/>

    <img src="/PhoenixCB/phoenix13.png" style={{zoom:0.25}}/>

    After dodging the collision of these MIRVs, you can use shield reflection. In this position, you can activate as many lasers as possible, and the reflection position is also precisely able to destroy the Roc:

    <img src="/PhoenixCB/phoenix14.png" style={{zoom:0.25}}/>

    A full illustration:

    <img src="/PhoenixCB/phoenix24.gif" style={{zoom:1}}/>

### Back Reflection

This strategy is typically used when there are two eagles in the front row because you will be blocked by a large number of shurikens and cannot activate as many lasers as possible in the front. Its key points are relatively simple: after the initial prefire, dive to the back row to activate the MIRVs, then use a Destructive Wave before activating shield reflection.

<img src="/PhoenixCB/phoenix11.png" style={{zoom:0.25}}/>

<img src="/PhoenixCB/phoenix23.gif" style={{zoom:1}}/>

### Continuous Reflection

This strategy is aimed at situations where there are consecutive waves where shield reflection should be used to destroy invaders. Specifically, in consecutive waves where each wave has at least two MIRV Bloomers, the benefit of forcibly reflecting is higher than waiting for cooldown to recover and only using the main cannon.

For example, after the previous wave of Roc ends, the following formation immediately appears:

<img src="/PhoenixCB/phoenix15.png" style={{zoom:0.25}}/>

At this moment, your shield cooldown has just started, so it's not wise to forcibly activate the shield directly in the middle of the screen. Firstly, you haven't utilized the main cannon to break the shields, and secondly, there's a high risk of making mistakes due to the long cooldown time. Therefore, we recommend that you first prefire and use the Destructive Wave to eliminate the first round of MIRVs, then reflect in the second round. During this time, not only can you break some shields, but you can also reduce the cooldown time for activating the shield again.

A full illustration:

### No Reflection

Sometimes, even if the invaders have laser MIRV Bloomers, giving up shield reflection may become a wise choice. This is usually because you have already used shield reflection twice in a row, making the benefit of reflecting again very low. It may also be because the damage reflected is not enough to destroy more invaders, and using more Destructive Waves may be more efficient.

In this case, the MIRV Bloomers become obstructive gun turrets, and you must prioritize their removal. For eagles, using Destructive Wave immediately after the laser MIRVs are released can effectively reduce the threat.

And your goal is to kill this eagle first:

## Conclusion

Phoenix speedrun usually refers to Delta Phoenix speedrun, which requires you to have a good understanding and comprehensive application of the main cannon, Destructive Waves, and shield reflection. In missions, whether you pay attention to various details will be an important factor in determining your performance, and using shield reflection correctly is paramount.
