> An introduction on how to play certain ships.

## Introduction

This series is a bottomless pit, and I don't know when I'll feel like updating it again. The content in this section aims to analyze the unique gameplay of some ships from the perspective of a skilled player, including some conventional techniques and lesser-known ~~inhuman~~ strategies.

The game itself leans towards hardcore, so some techniques may require a certain level of gaming experience to understand. When you look at the top scores on the leaderboard, you may be curious about how to improve your own skills. The purpose of creating this section is to present various gameplay styles of different ship to help you better understand the game.

Of course, I don't expect all players to follow the guides step by step. However, improving your gaming skills, aside from talent, is also about accumulating practice over time. Therefore, if you want to master a certain skill, besides reading this guide, you also need to practice the relevant techniques diligently in the game. Some techniques may be difficult, but don't be discouraged by their difficulty. As the editor, I will ensure that all skills included here have feasible practice methods. Apart from purely flashy techniques, I will also try to incorporate the principles and practical scenarios of the techniques in the content to help you better understand and practice them.

Updates to the content of this section are entirely based on the editor's mood, so if there's a particular ship you really want to learn about, please contact the responsible person for this site.
