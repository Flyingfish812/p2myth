## Introduction

Orion can be considered a rather special presence among the total of 100 ships. Orion can only rely on its Main Weapon for attacks, and the two apexes do not provide any new attack forms for it. Additionally, because its Main Weapon is perfect homing, coupled with its armored design, it doesn't require critical hits or core hits (yes, this is why I don't have the guts to challenge Heechi). This makes it difficult for Orion to significantly differentiate its solo scores. Therefore, this is the most hopeful sBoB for newcomers. Of course, although there are still some techniques involved, in my opinion, when it comes to soloing with Orion, grinding is more important than skill, so you may need to be mentally prepared to sacrifice 5-8 hours of your time.

I will explain it in several aspects.

## Main Weapon

The fully upgraded Orion Main Weapon fires once every 2 seconds, releasing 16 shots each time, with each shot dealing approximately 3.125 damage (tested by myself), totaling 50. Therefore, one round of Main Weapon fire can only take down 8 sparrows instead of 12. Each shot from the Main Weapon is fired from the center of the Orion at a random angle, with a certain sequence. Initially, each shot flies for a period without guidance but with attack capabilities. After a certain flight duration, it will turn towards a target and attack (it is said to target the invader with the smallest aiming turn angle, but personally, I don't feel it's entirely accurate; however, this is not crucial). If the target is destroyed during flight, it will redirect towards another target. In theory, if the invader's health is just right, there should be no situation where one with low health remains unscathed. However, in practice, this often occurs, especially in the first two waves. For example, situations like 8 sparrows / 4 sparrows + 1 raven / 2 ravens should theoretically unfold as follows:

But such incidents often occur, and when they happen once, you have to restart. Even managing it three times in a row is not easy. From wave 1-1 to 1-4, even when they fly back to assist me with a shot, it's still to no avail.

My observation is that when two Invaders overlap, causing one of them to receive excessive damage, it results in a wave that should have been just right to be insufficient.

Several methods can reduce the probability of this happening. According to my experiments, for a combination of 4 sparrows and 1 raven, the clear rate at 60 fps is approximately 70%, while at 120 fps, it's around 90%. This might be because higher fps can more accurately identify the subtle differences in hitboxes. This leads to another method to avoid this situation, which is to *activate Teleport* shortly after firing the Main Weapon *to slow down time by about 10 times*. The success rate of this method is almost 100%. I say "almost" because I have never experienced a failure with this method, even at 60 fps.

However, this method has two drawbacks: it prolongs the actual time of a game session, and it requires unlocking the Teleport.

## Teleport

Regarding Teleport, this issue deserves thorough exploration. Originally, it's a survival skill, yet it's not conducive to solo speedrunning. Because Orion's Main Weapon is non-intelligent fire control, it fires whenever the screen is touched, regardless of the presence of invaders. This leads to wasting a round of Main Weapon fire during the transition between waves because releasing the touch triggers Teleport automatically, affecting rhythm control. Therefore, generally speaking, Orion without the Teleport skill unlocked has an advantage in speedrunning. Of course, this requires higher dodging abilities.

## Speed Up

It can be said that if you want to speedrun, you should consider removing the Teleport from Orion. The specific method is to start with a new account and upgrade Orion from scratch, only upgrading the Main Weapon and Aura, without unlocking Zen. Of course, if you want, you can even don't upgrad the Aura because, ultimately, the Aura is only for survival purposes. If you're adept at dodging through bullet hell like *some players*, then the Aura is redundant for you.

Let's briefly discuss how to speedrun after removing the Teleport. Due to the perfectly guided nature of the Main Weapon, there is almost no possibility of missing shots, so the timing of Main Weapon release is crucial. Generally, during the transition between acts (such as just before wave X-1 starts), you can tap the screen to release the Main Weapon when the subtitle "Act X" is about to fly off the screen. These shots should return just in time to hit the invaders, saving about half a second.

You may have noticed that when you don't need to consider the Teleport slowdown, the timing of Main Weapon release is entirely up to you. The biggest advantage is that you no longer need to worry about wasting time due to the Main Weapon flying out and not returning. However, the conditions for this are also very strict: basically, no player will ever realize that Orion might need to speedrun one day, so no one will keep that Teleport locked.

Therefore, to speed up the Orion solo mission, three points are very important.

1. Prepare the Main

As mentioned earlier, even with Teleport, it can still be used at the beginning of each act or in waves with vultures later on. Simply put, you should fire the first round of Main Weapon shots as early as possible, then trigger bullet homing to attack when the invaders settle, saving some time. One issue is that Teleport can interfere when setting up ambushes in waves other than 1-1. Without Teleport, you only need to time the readiness of various invaders well. For example, if there are only sparrows, they will be in position relatively quickly, so you can set up the ambush in advance. However, for waves with vulture in the front, they will take longer to get into position, so you need to fire later. A rare set is a single Roc, as it moves into position very slowly, making it difficult to time the ambush correctly.

2. Closer attack to finish a wave

This is easy to understand, advancing to the next wave early or advancing to settle early. Although it may only save 0.2 seconds at a time, sometimes that 0.2 seconds makes all the difference.

3. Keep the Main

The first 3 acts with easy waves are crucial for speedrun. The principle behind this skill is that by annihilating an invader at the moment the Main Weapon is released, although the other Main Weapon shots have already been fired, they can return in time at the beginning of the next wave. This effectively splits one Main Weapon shot between two waves of use, maximizing the efficiency of Main Weapon output.

The key is to attack on the invader when there's only one invader left in the wave. This will kill it immediately, allowing the next wave of invaders to arrive promptly. Consequently, when the next wave of invaders is in position, the Main Weapon from the previous wave can still engage in guided attacks. This can potentially save a round of Main Weapon fire (2 seconds) for the next wave's attack, a gap that cannot be compensated for by any movement details. For example, in this scenario, where the next wave originally required three rounds of Main Weapon fire for the eagles, one round is saved here.

First, you need to determine whether you can save a round of Main Weapon fire between two waves. For example, if the total health of both waves is 80, then four rounds of Main Weapon fire will definitely be required, and it's impossible to save a round. If the health of each wave is approximately 60, there's a high probability of saving a round of Main Weapon fire. However, there's an exception: if you save some Main Weapon shots in the first wave, although not enough to kill the second wave of invaders, it can increase the number of saved Main Weapon shots for the second wave, potentially allowing you to save a round of Main Weapon fire for the subsequent wave. Therefore, it's advisable to devise a strategy before starting to ensure that no opportunities to save are missed.

Another scenario is when there are front vulture in the next wave. Even if you save a few shots from the previous wave, once the next wave is in position, those Main Weapon shots will have disappeared and become useless.

So the next question is how to leave only one invader in the wave. For a simple example, if there are two herons in the wave, flying in the lower half of the screen will most likely result in both being simultaneously killed. However, if you use the second round of Main Weapon fire to engage one of the herons closely and destroy it, the third round can then engage the other one up close, bringing a small amount of damage into the next wave. In general, engaging closely always has advantages. Here are a few examples:

Start by engaging up close and killing two ravens,

<video src="/Orion/5.mp4" controls></video>

In the upper half of the screen, horizontally spread out the Main Weapon fire evenly and pray that it can kill all four sparrows in one round (low success rate, mainly requiring guts).

<video src="/Orion/6.mp4" controls></video>

Shout "EL bless me" out loud and pray that it will just kill two ravens (almost zero success rate, not recommended unless absolutely necessary).

<video src="/Orion/7.mp4" controls></video>

In conclusion, Orion solo is the sBoB that depends least on techniques. The strategy is the "1" and determination is the string of "0"s that follow. The size of the number depends on how long you can grind.
