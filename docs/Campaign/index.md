# Campaign

> The great event containing 30 missions, updated at version 7.0

Looking forward, looking forward, the update has arrived, and the steps of the new content are getting closer.

One of the major contents for the 7.0 update is the **Campaign** mode, which includes 30 missions. Unlike the **Daily Missions**, these missions are permanent.

## Introduction

:::note[Long long ago ...]

This story takes place after the release of the Android version.

When the development team joyfully released the Android version, they expected to attract more new players to the game. However, to their surprise, many new players uninstalled the game just a few days after downloading it.

This wasn’t good news. The producer gathered feedback from some of these players and found out that the problem was the mere three daily missions. For the ambitious newcomers, this was far too little, and they quickly lost interest.

But the veterans know all too well that grinding through three daily missions is truly time-consuming, especially when it involves competing for rankings every day. For new players, it’s different. The missions at low **Leagues** are indeed easy, but advancing in rank is limited to one level per day. Additionally, the credits in the beginner stages are too scarce, and who knows how long it will take to have a good ship of their own.

So, the development team made a quick decision to design an additional set of missions specifically for the newcomers. The highest difficulty of these missions only reaches the **Gold League**, making the gameplay volume and difficulty just right for the beginners. At the same time, the **Campaign** mode can also fill in the gaps in the game’s storyline, allowing players to better understand the game's background.

But what exactly should the game’s storyline be...?

--- All of the above is off-topic ---

:::

**Campaign** mode is a game mode that is independent of the **Daily Missions**, and the mission configurations are fixed, with relatively lower difficulty. The **Campaign** mode includes the game’s storyline, aiming to help new players better understand the game (veterans might not even know what the game's story is about).

The **Campaign** mode is divided into 8 chapters, totaling 30 missions. Each chapter corresponds to one of the maps in the game (there are 7 maps in the game, and an additional "Wormhole" map is added in the campaign mode).
