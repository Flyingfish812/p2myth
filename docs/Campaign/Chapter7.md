# Chapter 7: Dovacoon Forge

We have arrived at **Dovacoon Forge**, and Marshal Liss has instructed us to launch a revenge operation.

### Mission 23

We need to first break through the perimeter defenses, so we must quickly strike their defenses. Marshal Liss grants us permission to pilot the [EX04239](/Ship/EX04239.md) (Phi) fighter for this strike mission.

Instructor Crubbs advises that this fighter is a pure offense model with no defense, so we must focus on taking down the invaders as quickly as possible.

This mission requires the use of EX04239 and consists of 20 waves of armored invaders:

- Sparrow 2; Raven 1; Raven 1 + Sparrow 2; Raven 2
- Sparrow 5; Raven 1 + Sparrow 2; Raven 1 + Sparrow 4; Raven 3
- Vulture 1 + Sparrow 4; Heron 1 + Raven 2; Eagle 1 + Raven 2; Raven 6 + Sparrow 1
- Vulture 1 + Sparrow 4; Heron 2 + Raven 3 + Sparrow 2; Eagle 1 + Raven 2; Eagle 1 + Raven 4
- Vulture 1 + Sparrow 4; Eagle 2 + Heron 2 + Sparrow 2; Eagle 1 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 2; Condor 1 + Raven 4 + Sparrow 3

At act 3, the enemy introduces laser weapons, and Mian Operator warns us to be cautious.

At the end of the mission, Marshal Liss reminds us to move on to the second phase.

### Mission 24

Marshal Liss informs us that the external defenses have collapsed, and we need to return to our own fighters and continue the assault.

Each pilot must focus on their designated targets, and Captain Merrick comments that it feels good to fly again.

A new type of enemy appears in this mission: the **satellite**. It has no offensive capabilities and is merely a decorative meat shield.

This mission consists of 20 waves of unshielded invaders:

- Sparrow 2; Sparrow 4; Raven 1; Raven 2
- Raven 1 + Sparrow 2; Raven 2 + Sparrow 2; Heron 1; Raven 3 + Sparrow 2
- Satellite 1; Eagle 1 + Sparrow 2; Heron 2 + Sparrow 4; Heron 3 + Sparrow 2
- Heron 2 + Raven 2; Vulture 1 + Heron 2 + Sparrow 2; Heron 3 + Raven 2; Satellite 1 + Sparrow 4
- Raven 7 + Sparrow 2; Heron 3 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 2; Eagle 1 + Heron 2; Vulture 1 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 1

After wave 3-2 and at the end of the mission, you receive a warning from the **Roc**. Mian Operator expresses interest in your ability to communicate with them.

Marshal Liss reminds you that there are more targets that need to be eliminated.

### Mission 25

Marshal Liss updates you with new strike coordinates.

As the mission begins, you once again receive a warning from the **Roc**.

This mission consists of 20 waves of unshielded invaders:

- Sparrow 3; Sparrow 3; Raven 1; Raven 1 + Sparrow 2
- Raven 1 + Sparrow 2; Raven 3; Raven 3 + Sparrow 2; Satellite 1 + Sparrow 4
- Heron 1 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 2; Eagle 1 + Raven 2; Heron 3 + Raven 2; Heron 4
- Vulture 1 + Heron 2; Satellite 1 + Sparrow 4; Condor 1; Heron 1 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 2
- Heron 4 + Raven 3 + Sparrow 2; Raven 6 + Sparrow 2; Eagle 2 + Satellite 1; Condor 1

At the end of act 4-2, you once again receive a threat from the **Roc**, but Mian Operator decides to triangulate the signal source to track the Roc.

At the end of the mission, as the **Roc** issues another warning, Mian Operator successfully pinpoints its location. Mian Operator seems to have discovered something that could work.

### Mission 26

Mian Operator believes that by getting close enough to the **Roc**, you can use the communication to launch a reverse hack. Therefore, our mission is to approach the **Roc**.

This mission consists of 20 waves of unshielded invaders:

- Sparrow 3; Raven 1 + Sparrow 4; Raven 2; Raven 3
- Raven 2; Raven 2 + Sparrow 4; Raven 3; Raven 3 + Sparrow 2
- Heron 1 + Raven 4; Heron 3 + Sparrow 2; Heron 3 + Raven 2; Vulture 1
- Vulture 1 + Raven 4 + Sparrow 4; Heron 2 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 2; Eagle 1 + Heron 2 + Sparrow 2; Condor 1 + Raven 4
- Vulture 1 + Heron 2 + Sparrow 2; Eagle 2 + Heron 1 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 2; Vulture 1 + Raven 6; Roc 1 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 7

At the end of act 2, the **Roc** issues another warning, and Mian Operator realizes that the reverse hack might actually work. After act 4, you get even closer to the Roc.

After wave 5-3, Mian Operator successfully hacks the **Roc**, allowing you to attack freely. In fact, the turrets on this Roc are almost pathetically weak.

After the **Roc** is destroyed, it expresses no resentment and mentions that the invaders will be endless. However, for now, our mission is temporarily complete.

For destroying the Roc, we receive an additional reward of 1000 points.

Mian Operator points out that the situation is worrying, as the invaders are planning a large-scale attack on the **Prometheus Array**. Our final mission will take place there.
