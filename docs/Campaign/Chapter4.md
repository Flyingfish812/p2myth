# Chapter 4: Archology CQ-6

Mian Operator mentions in surprise that the invaders actively contacted you, and thanks to their signal, they were able to find you.

> So, it can actually be understood that the invaders originally had no intention of invading, but we forcibly regarded them as enemies.

### Mission 11

Arriving at the *Archeology CQ-6* map, you discover various facilities in the jungle. Captain Merrick asks you to check what's left.

This mission consists of 16 waves of shielded invaders:

- Sparrow 3; Sparrow 3; Sparrow 4; Raven 1;
- Sparrow 6; Raven 2; Raven 2 + Sparrow 3; Heron 1 + Sparrow 2
- Raven 4 + Sparrow 2; Eagle 1 + Sparrow 4; Eagle 1 + Raven 2; Heron 2 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 2
- Eagle 1 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 1; Heron 1 + Raven 4; Raven 3 + Sparrow 2; Eagle 1 + Heron 2

At the start of the fourth act, Mian Operator reminds you that they will scan while you fight. After the fourth act ends, Captain Merrick discovers that many facilities are still operational.

### Mission 12

Captain Merrick orders you to act quickly before the enemy can send reinforcements. This is the staging area for the enemy's recent attacks, and it seems like there is little defense.

This mission consists of 16 waves of shielded invaders:

- Sparrow 2; Sparrow 3; Sparrow 3; Raven 1
- Sparrow 6; Raven 1 + Sparrow 2; Heron 1 + Sparrow 2; Heron 1 + Raven 2
- Heron 1 + Sparrow 2; Heron 1 + Raven 2; Heron 2 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 2; Heron 3 + Sparrow 2
- Eagle 1 + Heron 2; Heron 4; Eagle 1 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 4; Heron 1 + Raven 4 + Sparrow 1

After act 3, Captain Merrick asks you to carefully clear the area for a closer inspection. After the fight, Captain Merrick spots many invaders and suggests you pilot one of them.

### Mission 13

Captain Merrick asks if you can pilot the captured invader. If anyone can handle it, it’s you.

*Well then, now it truly feels like we're the invaders.*

In these two missions, your ship will be forcibly changed to the "captured Raven." Its stats are as follows:

- Main weapon: T2 Dart (highest-mark, fastest firing rate), 20 DPS damage, critical hit main weapon
- Aura: Shield, capable of blocking 26 bullets, requiring energy equivalent to a phalanx to activate
- Zen: T2 Tracking Laser, requiring 1.8 seconds to charge, followed by 3 seconds of continuous attack, dealing 50 DPS (150 total damage). Each activation increases cooldown by 2 seconds, cooldown recovery is 4 seconds.

*Let you experience the feeling of being untouchable by invaders.*

*Don’t worry, your turrets won’t be destroyed by invaders, consider yourself lucky.*

**Key operations**: Face the invader and shoot with your darts, activate the shield when energy is full, then charge the laser for maximum output.

This mission consists of 16 waves of shielded invaders:

- Sparrow 4; Sparrow 4; Sparrow 6; Sparrow 6
- Sparrow 5; Sparrow 7; Raven 2; Heron 1 + Sparrow 2
- Raven 3; Heron 1 + Raven 2; Eagle 1 + Raven 2; Heron 2 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 2
- Vulture 1 + Raven 2; Heron 1 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 2; Heron 2 + Raven 2; Eagle 1 + Heron 2

In the first three waves, the invaders have **no turrets**, allowing you to familiarize yourself with the controls. Instructor Crubbs needs you to figure out how it works.

At the end of the first act, Captain Merrick shouts: "The disguise has been uncovered, blast your way out!"

After act 3, Captain Merrick has you receive an incoming message. Commander Khier requests that you bring this ship back safely.

After the mission, Commander Khier commends you for providing a unique opportunity, and he gives you the briefing for the next mission.

### Mission 14

Commander Khier mentions that the "captured Raven" is still connected to the enemy systems, which we can use to our advantage. Therefore, you need to fly as close to the facility as possible to collect data.

This mission consists of 20 waves of shielded invaders:

- Sparrow 2; Sparrow 3; Raven 1 + Sparrow 2; Raven 1 + Sparrow 2;
- Sparrow 8; Raven 2; Raven 2 + Sparrow 3; Heron 1 + Sparrow 4
- Heron 1 + Sparrow 4; Raven 3 + Sparrow 2; Eagle 1; Eagle 1 + Raven 2
- Heron 1 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 4; Heron 2 + Raven 2; Raven 2 + Sparrow 2; Eagle 1 + Raven 4
- Vulture 1 + Sparrow 4; Heron 1 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 2; Heron 1 + Sparrow 4; Condor 1

At the start of the mission, Mian Operator prepares to establish a connection. After 3-2 ends, the link is established, causing a tether to trail from the back of the ship.

At the end of the mission, Commander Khier says they’ve learned a lot from this, and the "captured Raven" will be handed over to the Special Operations team for further analysis.

With this, the first chapter's missions are completed. You will receive an additional reward of 500 points. The data you obtained mentions *Ceres Major*, so we need to head there for the next mission.
