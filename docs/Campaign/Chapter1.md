<!-- <img src="/Campaign/za.png" style={{zoom:0.5}}/> -->

Everything originated from a campaign planned by the instructors, represented by Operator Mian, aimed at analyzing and **attacking the invaders**...

> Is there a possibility that the real invaders are **us**?

*In campaign mode, you can switch to daily mission mode at any time.*

*The reward for clearing each wave of invaders in campaign mode is 5 credits.*

### Mission 1

Instructor Crubbs assigns you the first mission, and your journey begins in **Zhey Auna**. This was once a quiet area, but invasion activities have increased recently.

This mission consists of 12 waves of hull invaders:

- Sparrow 6; Raven 2; Heron 1; Heron 1 + Raven 2
- Sparrow 5; Raven 3 + Sparrow 2; Heron 1 + Raven 2; Eagle 1 + Raven 2

The bullets in this mission is not too dense, and you can pass easily as long as you dodge well.

*Instructor Crubbs will say after the mission: "Not bad, (your league), you've shown potential." If you're in the Marshal league, it will be "Not bad, Marshal."*

### Mission 2

Instructor Crubbs has discovered more invaders and sends you to retaliate and clear them out.

This mission consists of 12 waves of unshielded invaders:
