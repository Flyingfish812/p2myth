# Chapter 5: Ceres Major

**Ceres Major** is a desolate place, once a prosperous planet in the universe. However, due to an unknown disaster, the planet became barren and lifeless. Now, it has become a target for explorers hoping to find hidden treasures and secrets deep within the planet.

*The above information is AI-generated.*

### Mission 15

According to the invaders' data, these floating ruins may conceal secrets, as Commander Khier suggests.

This mission consists of 16 waves of armored invaders:

- Sparrow 2; Sparrow 3; Raven 1 + Sparrow 2; Raven 2
- Sparrow 7; Raven 2 + Sparrow 3; Heron 1 + Sparrow 4; Raven 3 + Sparrow 2
- Raven 2 + Sparrow 2; Raven 3 + Sparrow 2; Eagle 1 + Raven 2; Heron 3 + Raven 2
- Heron 1 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 2; Heron 2 + Raven 2; Heron 1 + Raven 2; Eagle 1 + Raven 4

After act 3, Mian Operator detects pulsing energy within the ruins. At the end of the mission, Mian Operator points out that this information indicates technology beyond our comprehension.

### Mission 16

Commander Khier discovers that there is a small area where the energy is particularly concentrated, and you are tasked with finding its source.

This area’s energy could benefit our position, *but is that really the case*?

This mission consists of 16 waves of armored invaders:

- Sparrow 3; Sparrow 3; Raven 1; Raven 2
- Sparrow 5; Raven 1 + Sparrow 4; Heron 1; Raven 3 + Sparrow 2;
- Heron 1 + Raven 2; Heron 2 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 2; Eagle 1 + Heron 2; Heron 3 + Raven 2
- Vulture 1 + Heron 2 + Sparrow 2; Eagle 1 + Sparrow 2; Heron 3 + Raven 2; Condor 1

At the end of act 3, Mian Operator locks onto the target’s exact location. After 4-2, Commander Khier discovers the artifact’s manifestation.

Commander Khier will commend you for finding the artifact, as it could provide an advantage against the invaders.

### Mission 17

The invaders have realized the power of the artifact, and we must protect it. However, Mian Operator warns that sensors are overloaded as a large number of invaders approach.

Instructor Crubbs suggests that the incoming invaders are shielded invaders, so switching to a more suitable ship is recommended.

This mission consists of 20 waves of shielded invaders:

- Sparrow 3; Sparrow 3; Raven 1; Raven 2
- Raven 1 + Sparrow 2; Raven 1 + Sparrow 4; Heron 1 + Raven 2; Heron 1 + Raven 2
- Heron 1 + Raven 2; Heron 2; Eagle 1 + Raven 2; Heron 2 + Raven 4
- Vulture 1 + Raven 2; Heron 1 + Raven 2; Eagle 1 + Heron 2 + Sparrow 2; Eagle 1 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 4
- Vulture 1 + Heron 2; Eagle 2 + Heron 2 + Sparrow 2; Eagle 2 + Raven 2; Condor 1

Mian Operator will notify you at the end of the second act that more invaders are approaching. After the third act, Mian Operator warns that a **Roc** is approaching from the side, and it will steal the artifact at 4-2. We need to catch up to it.

After the fourth act, Mian Operator begins tracking the **Roc**'s location. The mission ends with Mian Operator discovering that the **Roc** has jumped into the wormhole, and we need to pursue it.

### Mission 18

In the wormhole, the signal is weak, and Commander Khier orders you to recover the artifact. Mian Operator is tracking it, and we need to intercept.

This mission consists of 16 waves of armored invaders:

- Sparrow 3; Raven 1; Raven 1 + Sparrow 2; Raven 2
- Raven 1 + Sparrow 2; Raven 1 + Sparrow 2; Raven 4 + Sparrow 2; Heron 1 + Raven 2
- Raven 4 + Sparrow 2; Eagle 1 + Sparrow 2; Heron 2; Heron 3 + Raven 2
- Heron 2 + Raven 2; Vulture 1 + Raven 2; Eagle 2 + Heron 1 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 2; Roc (flying backward) 1

At the end of the third act, Mian Operator detects that the **Roc** is fleeing, and we need to continue the chase.

The **Roc**'s 10 turrets are mostly ineffective for attacking, with only the 4 dart turrets on its sides posing a threat, making the difficulty very low.

After defeating the **Roc**, Mian Operator urges you to leave quickly. Commander Khier remarks that if we can’t have the artifact, the invaders shouldn’t either.

Commander Khier will reward you with an additional 1000 points for your excellent performance.

At this point, Mian Operator suddenly mentions that contact with the colony **New Eden** has been lost, and orders Captain Merrick's squad to immediately report to Marshal Liss. Your next mission will be carried out in **Bright Sector \[3,84\]**.
