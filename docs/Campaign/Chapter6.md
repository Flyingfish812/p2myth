Captain Merrick's flight squad reports to Marshal Liss, who explains that the entire colony has been destroyed by the invaders. Therefore, you are ordered to follow Marshal Liss in scanning the entire area.

### Mission 19

Captain Merrick cannot comprehend what has happened, while Marshal Liss reminds him that there may still be survivors, and the search needs to be expanded.

*Marshal Liss's Phoenix and Captain Merrick’s Starless will split up to search.*

This mission consists of 20 waves of unshielded invaders:

- Sparrow 3; Sparrow 4; Raven 1 + Sparrow 2; Raven 1 + Sparrow 2

At the end of the mission, Mian Operator orders you to jump, and Captain Merrick is also supposed to jump, but there’s no response from him.

With Captain Merrick missing, Marshal Liss instructs the formation of a search party to locate him.

At the end of act 2, you pass through a group of broken Kibarraxs (crabs), and Sergeant Vortannis thanks you.

After the fourth act, you pass by a group of damaged Jeria, and ace pilot Nyra thanks you.

At the end of the mission, Marshal Liss concludes that some pilots were rescued, but Captain Merrick was not found. She instructs the team to prepare to move to the next location.

### Mission 22

Commander Khier believes that **New Eden** has been reduced to a wasteland, and that they have rescued everyone they could. Thus, it is time to retreat from this fallen area. However, Marshal Liss insists on conducting one more search.

You need to clear the area of invaders to search for the missing Captain Merrick.

At the end of act 2, there are no findings. After act 4, still no results, and Commander Khier suggests preparing for the worst.

After 5-2, Mian Operator receives a faint signal. After the mission, you receive this unknown signal as well. Mian Operator will dispatch a team to pick up Captain Merrick, and a damaged Starless flies by on the screen. Marshal Liss expresses her relief at hearing Captain Merrick’s voice again.

The chapter concludes, and you will receive an additional 1000 points. Marshal Liss proposes a surprise attack on the invaders, while Mian Operator mentions that the data points towards **Dovacoon Forge**, where your next mission will take place.
