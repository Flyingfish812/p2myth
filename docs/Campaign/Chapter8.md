# Chapter 8: Prometheus Array

We have arrived at **Prometheus Array**, our main energy source, and Marshal Liss has ordered Commander Khier to organize the defense.

*Side note: The color scheme of this map is harsh on the eyes, so try not to play on it for too long.*

### Mission 27

Commander Khier mentions that multiple attacks from the invaders have been detected, and they are testing our defenses. We need to eliminate them.

This mission consists of 16 waves of armored invaders:

- Sparrow 3; Sparrow 4; Raven 1 + Sparrow 4; Raven 3
- Sparrow 6; Raven 2; Heron 1 + Sparrow 4; Raven 3 + Sparrow 2
- Raven 4; Heron 2 + Raven 3 + Sparrow 2; Eagle 2; Eagle 1 + Heron 2 + Sparrow 2
- Sparrow 48; Eagle 2 + Heron 2 + Raven 1; Eagle 2; Vulture 1 + Heron 2 + Sparrow 4

At the end of act 3, Commander Khier will warn you that a wave of Sparrow-class invaders is approaching. This is the only **Sparrow swarm** configuration in the current version of the game.

After the mission, Commander Khier instructs you to jump out and prepare for the next action.

### Mission 28

Marshal Liss says that you only took out the vanguard; the rest of their fleet is approaching. Plans stolen by Mian Operator reveal that a massive fleet is headed our way.

This mission consists of 20 waves of shielded invaders:

- Raven 1 + Sparrow 4; Raven 1 + Sparrow 4; Raven 2; Raven 3
- Raven 2; Raven 2 + Sparrow 4; Heron 1 + Sparrow 2; Raven 3
- Heron 1 + Sparrow 4; Heron 2 + Raven 3 + Sparrow 2; Eagle 1 + Heron 2 + Sparrow 2; Eagle 2 + Heron 2
- Heron 3 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 2; Heron 4 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 2; Condor 1 + Sparrow 5; Heron 4 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 1
- Vulture 1 + Heron 2 + Raven 4; Eagle 1 + Heron 2 + Raven 2; Eagle 1 + Heron 2 + Raven 4; Condor 1 + Heron 2

At the end of act 3, Mian Operator warns you that a large number of invaders are on their way, and it will be a tough battle. After 4-2, ace pilot **Nyra** decides to join your fight, saying you shouldn’t be the only one enjoying it. Thus, the **Condor** in 4-3 will be instantly killed by Nyra with three Vorpal Lances.

At the end of the mission, Marshal Liss will praise you for holding the line against overwhelming odds. Instructor Crubbs will secure 1000 points for you to upgrade.

### Mission 29

The next wave of attacks is imminent, containing many large invaders.

This mission consists of 20 waves of shielded invaders:

- Sparrow 2; Sparrow 3; Raven 1 + Sparrow 4; Heron 1
- Raven 2; Raven 2 + Sparrow 4; Heron 1 + Sparrow 4; Heron 1 + Raven 2
- Raven 4 + Sparrow 2; Heron 2 + Sparrow 4; Raven 6 + Sparrow 1; Vulture 1
- Vulture 1 + Heron 2 + Raven 4; Heron 3 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 2; Vulture 1 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 4; Eagle 1 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 4
- Eagle 4; Vulture 1 + Heron 2 + Sparrow 4; Eagle 1 + Heron 2 + Raven 2; Condor 1 + Heron 2 + Sparrow 2

At the end of act 2, Instructor Crubbs warns you to be cautious of the **Doomsday turrets** on the invaders, especially the red zones they project. From this wave forward, Doomsday weapons will appear.

After act 4, Captain Merrick says he still hasn’t thanked you for finding him in **New Eden** and wants to show off some cool moves. Thus, the four **Eagles** in 5-1 will be instantly destroyed by Merrick’s two **Goliath missiles**.

At the end of the mission, Marshal Liss remarks that at this rate, success is within reach.

### Mission 30

Commander Khier mentions that the invaders are gathering for a final assault on this side. Instructor Crubbs reminds you to switch to your favorite ship and prepare for battle.

This mission consists of 20 waves of shielded invaders:

- Sparrow 4; Raven 1 + Sparrow 4; Raven 1 + Sparrow 4; Heron 1
- Raven 2; Raven 2 + Sparrow 4; Heron 1 + Sparrow 2; Eagle 1
- Eagle 1 + Raven 2; Heron 2 + Raven 3 + Sparrow 2; Heron 2 + Raven 4; Eagle 2 + Heron 2 + Raven 1
- Vulture 1 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 1; Eagle 1 + Raven 4; Eagle 1 + Heron 2; Condor 1 + Sparrow 5
- Vulture 1 + Heron 2 + Raven 4; Eagle 1 + Heron 2 + Raven 2; Vulture 1 + Eagle 2; Roc 1

At the end of act 1, the **Roc** threatens you, claiming they are as endless as the stars. At the end of act 2, Captain Merrick says there are too many invaders. After act 3, ace pilot Nyra mentions that we've been exposed and the invaders have sent out their strongest fighter.

After 4-2, Marshal Liss says he will arrive shortly. He uses a special **Phoenix mega bomb** to destroy all bullets along with the **Condor** right as its barrage is about to overwhelm you.

*So why does your Phoenix have a mega bomb that clears the screen? I want one too!*

Before entering 5-4, the **Roc** issues its final threat. This Roc is slightly stronger than the previous ones, but you can pass with careful maneuvering.

After defeating the Roc, Marshal Liss expresses, "This is what victory feels like." Captain Merrick adds, "It’s amazing we’re all still here—drinks are on me!" Ace pilot Nyra says, "We’ll show them who’s boss."

### Epilogue

"The area is secure, and Prometheus Array is safe for now."

"Innumerable invaders are still pouring toward us, but today marks a special victory."

"The battle here is over, for now. More invaders will come, and when they do, we’ll be ready."

---

"Wow! What a journey! I still remember assigning you your first ship like it was yesterday."

"But… the battle isn’t over. Your daily missions are always ready and waiting for you!"

This concludes the **Campaign** mode.
