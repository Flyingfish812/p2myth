# Chapter 3: Wormhole

In the wormhole, the signal is weak, and you can only hear intermittent static. You must face all the invaders alone.

### Mission 9

You can still pick up faint signals from Mian Operator, but the information is completely unrecognizable.

This mission consists of 16 waves of unshielded invaders:

- Sparrow 2; Sparrow 3; Raven 1; Raven 1 + Sparrow 2
- Sparrow 7; Raven 1 + Sparrow 2; Raven 1 + Sparrow 4; Raven 2
- Raven 3 + Sparrow 2; Heron 1 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 2; Heron 2; Eagle 1 + Raven 2
- Eagle 1 + Heron 2; Raven 3 + Sparrow 2; Heron 1 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 2; Vulture 1 + Heron 2

Before the act 4 begins, you receive a garbled message from the invaders.

### Mission 10

The intermittent signal from the invaders unsettles you, and you have no choice but to continue advancing blindly.

This mission consists of 16 waves of unshielded invaders:

- Sparrow 2; Sparrow 3; Sparrow 3; Raven 1 + Sparrow 2
- Raven 2 + Sparrow 3; Raven 2 + Sparrow 4; Heron 1 + Raven 2; Heron 2
- Heron 1 + Sparrow 2; Raven 3; Eagle 1; Heron 1 + Raven 2
- Vulture 1 + Sparrow 4; Eagle 1 + Heron 2; Heron 1 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 2; Condor 1 + Raven 4 + Sparrow 2

After the act 3, Mian Operator's signal becomes clearer, and it seems like theyâ€™ve found you. However, this mission marks the first appearance of the Condor, a large, heavily armored but not particularly aggressive guy.

At the end, Mian Operator instructs you to jump immediately. With that, the wormhole missions conclude, and you will jump to another region to carry out the next set of missions.
