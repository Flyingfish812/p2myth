# Chapter 2: Gau Prime

You have arrived at *Gau Prime*. What kind of invaders will you face here?

### Mission 5

Captain Merrick plans to have you patrol the corridors. There are many shielded invaders in this area that need to be cleared.

This mission consists of 16 waves of shielded invaders:

- Sparrow 2; Sparrow 3; Sparrow 3; Sparrow 4
- Sparrow 5; Raven 2; Raven 2 + Sparrow 3; Heron 1 + Raven 2
- Raven 3 + Sparrow 2; Heron 1 + Raven 2; Raven 6 + Sparrow 1; Heron 3 + Raven 2
- Eagle 1 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 1; Heron 1 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 4; Eagle 1 + Sparrow 2; Vulture 1 + Sparrow 5

Once this area is cleared, Mian Operator gives instructions to dispatch an escort team through here.

### Mission 6

Mian Operator alerts you to a distress signal, and we need to pilot the prepared Phoenix (Delta) ship to intercept the invaders attacking the escort team.

In this mission, your ship will be forcibly switched to the Delta [Phoenix](/Ship/Phoenix.md). This ship has a shield-breaking main weapon, a bullet EMP (destructive wave), and a personal shield. Due to its high strength, this mission will be relatively easy.

This mission consists of 16 waves of shielded invaders:

- Sparrow 3; Sparrow 4; Raven 1; Raven 1 + Sparrow 2;
- Sparrow 8; Raven 2 + Sparrow 4; Raven 2 + Sparrow 4; Heron 1 + Raven 2
- Raven 3; Raven 4 + Sparrow 2; Eagle 1 + Sparrow 4; Heron 3 + Raven 2
- Heron 3 + Sparrow 2; Eagle 1 + Raven 4; Heron 1 + Raven 2; Vulture 1 + Sparrow 4

Escort team AXV-515 will call for assistance from all available ships before the fourth act begins. After defeating the fourth wave, the escort team’s ship will fly in to thank you.

### Mission 7

Captain Merrick decides to assign a reconnaissance mission to identify the source of the invaders. At the start of the mission, Mian Operator will conduct a full scan.

This mission consists of 16 waves of shielded invaders:

- Sparrow 3; Raven 1; Raven 1 + Sparrow 2; Raven 1 + Sparrow 2
- Sparrow 5; Raven 1 + Sparrow 2; Heron 1; Heron 1 + Sparrow 4
- Sparrow 6; Raven 2; Raven 3; Eagle 1 + Raven 2
- Heron 1 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 2; Heron 2 + Raven 4; Eagle 1 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 4; Vulture 1 + Sparrow 8

At the start of the fourth act, Mian Operator reports detecting an anomaly. At the end of the mission, Mian Operator obtains the coordinates of the anomaly, and the next mission will take place at those coordinates.

Captain Merrick will say that you’ve proven yourself as a top pilot, earning a promotion, and will inform you that there are additional daily missions available at any time. You can earn points and advance in rank from daily missions.

### Mission 8

Captain Merrick sends you to approach the coordinates to observe the anomaly.

This mission consists of 16 waves of unshielded invaders:

- Sparrow 2; Sparrow 3; Raven 1; Raven 1 + Sparrow 2
- Sparrow 5; Raven 2; Heron 1 + Sparrow 2; Heron 1 + Raven 2
- Sparrow 5; Raven 3 + Sparrow 2; Eagle 1; Heron 1 + Raven 2
- Vulture 1 + Sparrow 8; Heron 2 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 2; Heron 1 + Raven 2 + Sparrow 4; Heron 3 + Raven 2

At the start of the fourth act, the anomaly appears; after completing 4-1, Mian Operator informs you that they come from a wormhole; after 4-2, Captain Merrick orders you to return. However, the wormhole is too strong, and you cannot escape.

With this, the second chapter’s missions are completed. You must fight through the third chapter in the *Wormhole*.
