## Trivia

- Dragonfly Epsilon is one of the 4 apexes with an additional hidden change as well, changing its main weapon into a sort of rainbow colored laser gun, tightening the spread of the main.
- Its main's DPS is lower than Corsair's Tracking Minigun.

This apex also changes its main weapon to a laser minigun of tighter spread which travels much faster.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_45_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Overcharge
- Type: Aura
- Description: Overcharged Ion Cannon stuns targets in a larger area.
- Interpretation: The stun radius increases from 90 to 100.
- Form: Gamma
- Price: 15000
- Score: 1.82 / 5

It's a pity that if you put the two APEXes of the Ion Cannon on the same ship, the Blast Amplifier will definitely be more powerful than the Overcharge. Not only because the Blast Amplifier can increase damage, but also because the stun radius of an Overcharged Ion Cannon is not much better than that of an Blast Amplifier.
