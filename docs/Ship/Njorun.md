## Survival

- Because of how each of its Aura and Zen are so capable of covering the different types of dangers, with a minor overlap between Aura and Zen, Njörun is extremely capable of surviving anything that is thrown at it with ease. However, it does require the right hands to pull it off as misuse of its Aura and Zen will result in bad results.
- The main defence comes in the form of CF. CF is your first defence when you are immediately threatened.
- Njörun relies quite a lot on Chrono Hopping, essentially using the Chrono Phase Out time to throw yourself into a safer spot.
- If it is not possible to find a safe spot to Chrono Hop to, literally flick yourself away from the fading CF. When i mean flick, i mean to use your finger (or stylus) to make a very quick swipe and lift it off the surface of your device. This allows the activation of PS while the ship is still moving, clearing out a bit more bullets than normally possible with PS. Hide in PS as long as you need (be careful not to stay too long until PS expires).
- The very short Phase Out time of PS is very key for Njörun since using PS in bullet dense missions is one of the key success factors of Njörun. Learn to utilize it to clear a small region of bullets.
- Usually there should be enough particles after you use each Chrono, particularly after PS (which is used after the Chrono Phase Out). Even in the longest fights, you should have generally gained a bit of particles, enough for another smaller CF.
- Because of Njörun's relatively high DPS of 31.25, it eliminates invaders quite fast and thus particles are generally not of issue.
- It is ok to use PS inside of CF, as CF is nothing but a panic button, and PS isn't usually needed after a Chrono for Njörun's rather quick invader clearing capability. You should always aim to utilize PS' laser reflect when there are sufficient lasers, whether or not CF is deployed. A sub-focus of Njörun is also to kill fast since survivability is not too much of an issue.
- In daily missions, because Njörun has a sufficiently high DPS, there is very little need to use PS to Phase Out and clear bullets. You can simply use PS for fun against lasers, although try not to use PS against too few lasers as that will cut your DPS. Sometimes, it is not even necessary to use PS, but it is definitely viable in laser missions to do so.
- Used carefully, Njörun can easily be a one try one run clear, even on the hardest days.

## Speedrun

- CF for Njörun is used as a positional tool to optimize its main weapon to land as many of its projectiles on all the invaders. This will involve lots of tiny CF deployment and Chrono Hopping.
- Knowing how to spread your projectiles among the invaders in early Acts is key to speedrunning. Unfortunately, it requires 2 wave projectiles to kill a Sparrow. Bear that in mind when spreading your projectiles.
- The blast damage of Njörun from its one and only middle wave projectile in its burst is negligible and there's no point trying to optimize it. It has the capability to reduce the kill requirement of several Sparrows to 1 wave projectile, but don't count on that middle projectile.

## Fun

- PS is fun to use in these mission types due to the presence of lasers.
- Njörun's main weapon makes a pretty soothing yet satisfying sound.

## Trivia

- Njörun was only introduced into Phoenix 2 at v2.2.
- Njörun is the only ship in the game whose name contains an accented character which is ö.
- Njörun used to be one of the biggest meme ships in the game due to the initial version of CF, which was utterly useless. There were no ults when CF was first released so once the CF faded, you would be immediately vulnerable to bullets and lasers. This means that since Chrono slows and stacks bullets upon you, what you have after Chrono expires is an impenetrable wall of bullets. Combined with a useless PS that also had no ult of laser reflection, it is of no wonder Njörun was seen as useless in the past.
- Njörun, especially in its base form, strongly resembles a backwards-flying TIE Striker.
- As quoted: "Ever hear of a game called Dark Souls? This ship enables the hidden mode called Phoenix 2: Prepare to Die Edition. Njörun literally has nothing going for it with it's weak, slow firing, short burst main weapon. Additionally it has the two worst abilities to combo together. I don't know what happened here, Njörun is so bad that it's not even fun to use it as a joke. I'm afraid that now that I have said all of this, Njörun will somehow be good one day and be the kid in the class I shouldn't have made fun of after it takes over leaderboards and will haunt me in my dreams forever." Well, this guy probably regretted what he said, but he's still playing today as ever since the ult update, he has recognized how powerful Njörun has became.
- Njörun is of the only two SB ship with blast damage. Also, the blast damage is generally a joke as it only applies to the middle projectile that is only fired once in a single burst.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_58_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Deep Field
- Type: Aura
- Description: A slightly larger Chrono Field that also slows down turrets.
- Interpretation: The max radius increases by 25% (about 200), the turrets' speed are slowed down to 30%.
- Form: Lambda
- Price: 30000
- Score: 2.27 / 5

This apex encourages an interesting charge forward gameplay where you would take the risk to deploy CF at the end of the dash up movement, with the dash up performed at the start of most waves. This enables for some compression shots which benefits those who want to try and optimise Njörun’s main for the speed. It also helps in Roc battles where the bullet density becomes more manageable during the first 2 CFs which are large enough to cover many of the Roc’s turrets, enabling you to take out the dangerous turrets with the main quickly before they flood the field with bullets which stops you from disabling them.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_58_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Super Reflect
- Type: Zen
- Description: Split-second shield activation just before laser firing will reflect back with extra force.
- Interpretation: The lasers hitting the shield at the first 0.5s will be reflected back with 5x damage.
- Form: Gamma
- Price: 15000
- Score: 4.18 / 5

If you need a training mode for Super Reflect apexes, this apex is the way to go. The fact that lasers can still be reflected while you are completely invincible in CF makes this apex very easy to use. You need not worry about dying from a delayed deployment of PS from overheating it from a recent use. This makes it very easy to land a Super Reflect without the worry of dying. You can deploy PS a bit late and still survive even as lasers or DDLs shoot straight at you, but so long you are protected by CF, you will be totally fine. The Super Reflect makes Njörun an insane Roc killer, enabling it to go pretty fast, although not as fast as some of its other Super Reflect apexes, or some of the best speedrunners in laser missions. This apex is also a fun one to have since it's so fun to watch the invaders decimated from the insane damage boost from laser reflect. CF also allows PS to cool down such that it’ll become easier to time the next Super Reflect, if the previous wave died too fast. It may thus be more advantageous to allow one burst of lasers to be fired without a reflect, using CF as protection.
