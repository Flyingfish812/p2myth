## Survival

- The combination of BEMP + PS enables Jericho to hold its ground for quite a long time.
- PS should not be underestimated. It is very useful for cutting across a cluster of bullets, instead of wasting a BEMP to get past it. Knowing how far PS Phase Out will get you is essential.
- PS can also be used against MIRV Bloomers. Simply go up to the intersaction point of the rings of MIRVs released and deploy PS there to neutralize them.
- Otherwise, if there is no way to use PS to get yourself into a safer spot, BEMP should be used. BEMP is actually the primary tool to survive, since bullets are really everywhere in MIRV/Shuriken missions.
- In MIRV/Shuriken missions, because a majority of MIRVs are forward travelling, you can simply camp at one side of the field so that you don't face MIRVs on the other side of the field. T4 Shuriken Launchers can also fire right past you due to the gap in the middle of the pattern.
- PS can be used in laser missions to provide some extra DPS. In fact, whenever possible, use PS instead of the main, because the main is not only of low DPS, but inaccurate. Just remember to keep in mind the cooldown of PS.
- In General/Boomerang mission where lasers can track pretty fast, PS will also become an important tool in keeping up with survival. Use PS instead of BEMP in the first burst of lasers so that there is a chance to use PS again later on in the wave.
- If possible, use BEMP to reset the lasers just before the second round of lasers go off. This allows you to use PS again in the third wave, if any.
- Learn to use PS Phase Out to maximize bullet clearance.
- Unfortunately, the low DPS and the inaccurate main, killing invaders slowly, means that you often need to dodge. A LOT.
- The main is nowhere near reliable in popping turrets off, leaving you to face the whole mess of bullets everywhere.
- Jericho would be a good ship for its Aura Zen combination, having good resilience against both bullets and lasers, it's just a pity the main doesn't keep up which makes surviving a tall task.

## Speedrun

- While PS can be used as damage in laser present missions, the main's low DPS and inaccuracy make this ship really slow.

## Fun

- There's really nothing else to do with this ship other than to dodge bullets and use your Aura and Zen when threatened.
- The main weapon Inferno Seekers can be somewhat fun to watch, but its frustrating when it sometimes just doesn't hit your target.

## Trivia

- Jericho is one of the 3 starter ships you can get from your first warp gate activation.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_6_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Radar Upgrade
- Type: Main Weapon
- Description: Inferno Seekers now home in on enemy turrets.
- Interpretation: nan
- Form: Alpha
- Price: 5000
- Score: 2.09 / 5

This apex makes the Inferno Seekers lock onto active turrets instead of simply any target points on invaders, making it a much more effective turret popper.

The larger the invader, the more useful this apex is. The ability to strip an invader of highly dangerous turrets such as T4 shuriken launchers or MIRV Bloomers is a boost to survival when you are give. more space to dodge between the other bullets, reducing the need to use BEMP or PS especially when both options can be exhausted. This is particularly useful in a very lengthy battle against a Roc, where this apex gradually strips away turrets and make survival more manageable as your defensive options run low.

## APEX 2

- Name: Focus
- Type: Zen
- Description: Focused interconnects charge Personal Shield faster and recover it more quickly.
- Interpretation: The charge time decreases from 0.4s to 0.3s, the recovery time decreases from 6.5s to 4.5s.
- Form: Gamma
- Price: 15000
- Score: 2.27 / 5

The quick recovery of PS enables its abuse, particularly against continuous rounds of laser bursts. This is particularly against the heaviest or densest of waves, a prime example being 5-4. With the rather huge density of bullets on field, PS can also be comfortably used to Phase Out against walls of bullets when it is not worthwhile to reflect lasers. Just be careful to make sure the reflection of lasers does not kill off the last invaders of a wave so that it can be used again in the next wave.

In particular, this apex is the best tool to train your PS skills. BEMP allows you to make up for careless mistakes if you do not optimize PS enough. The increased usage of PS, as well as having BEMP as a fallback plan in case of sub-optimal results, allows you to experiment with abusing PS Phase Out to clear out as many bullets as possible.
