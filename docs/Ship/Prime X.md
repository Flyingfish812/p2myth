## Survival

- Although a lot about Prime X is to go fast, it is not very strict on the speed aspect. TP is a great saving grace which gets you out of sticky situations. There is leniency since both the main and Aura are burst fire.
- Although Prime X's main is lackluster since one burst of the vulcan is JUST unable to kill a Raven, this is actually of no issue since MS takes cares of the smaller invaders like Ravens and Sparrows, and sometimes even Herons.
- In daily missions, spamming MS continuously is the best chance of you surviving. Take care of the smaller invaders first before moving on to the bigger ones.
- Prime X's main can be used to pop dangerous turrets off. 2 bursts of the main is able to take down a Vulture's turret, and with the short interval between bursts, it's very fast. When one turret is popped off, you can quickly either swipe over to another turret, and simply TP there while the main recharges for another burst. This means very quick and efficient target switching.
- In daily missions, you can use the main to pop off turrets on larger invaders such as Eagles or above, after dealing with all the smaller invaders.
- However, the small spread of the main means that you may not be able to effectively disarm turret from afar.
- While Prime X cannot deal with lasers, the same turret popping strategy can be done for bigger invaders to eliminate the lasers rather quickly.
- For Ravens and Sparrows that have lasers that love to hide behind the Vulture, simply TP over to a top corner, and use an MS to quickly dispose of them. You can also avoid the lasers fired at you by hiding at one corner as the lasers fire, and use the opportunity to fire off an MS. Just be careful not to get too near Ravens that have dart turrets. You can TP over to an emptier space in that case.
- The combination of MS and TP means that Prime X has a very high level strategy that you can employ: While T3 and T4 dart tracking turrets are locked onto your reactor and firing away, quickly TP behind them and burst out your MS to instantly destroy a dangerous turret you desire. This is often useful for Condors and Rocs.

## Speedrun

- Prime X has a burst of 0.75s which means each burst does 31.25 × 0.75 = 23.4375 damage. This is just not enough to kill an Armor Raven. However, Ravens are dealt with using MS so this is of no issue. But it becomes a pain to optimize in earlier waves.
- Optimizing the main weapon in early waves are of absolute key. This is not too hard considering how consistent the main is. A few vulcan bullets will inevitably leak as you switch targets but it's quite minimal.
- Try to TP near to invaders so that you can get a better MS coverage, otherwise you might waste your MS. However, after MS is released, quickly retreat so that you don't eat too many particles and quickly overfill, especially in daily missions.
- Destroying key turrets and frontline invaders are also important as this gives you better freedom to move around, in order for MS to target more things. This allows MS to not go to waste.
- Prime X is one of the most consistent speedrunners due to its consistent main and Aura. It may not be the absolute fastest, but in the hands of the skilled, it can comfortably get you high places on the leaderboards.

## Fun

- The pacing of Prime X is actually very fun to catch. The main has a nice rhythm to it.
- The MS-TP "Tele-frag" kit is quite fun to pull off, and gives invaders a "peek-a-boo!"
- The main is quite satisfying to hear, although it is a bit short to enjoy fully.

## Trivia

- The Prime X's main weapon just falls short of killing the Armored Raven by one shot (Fxxk that's why I feel stuck when I speedrun it).

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_39_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Extended Clearance
- Type: Zen
- Description: Energy from the Teleport is released on arrival to extended the range of the Arrival EMP.
- Interpretation: The clearing space increases from 50 to 80.
- Form: Tau
- Price: 40000
- Score: 1.55 / 5

In the hells of MIRV/Shuriken missions, the increased clearance in space allows you to delete more MIRVs and thus find a safer spot to land at so that you won’t be greeted with too many MIRVs exploding in your face. It particularly helps in long battles such as during the Roc at 5-4.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_39_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Armor Piercing
- Type: Aura
- Description: Reinforced warheads allow these missiles to pierce enemy armor.
- Interpretation: The missiles ignore 30% damage reduction of armors.
- Form: Epsilon
- Price: 25000
- Score: 4.82 / 5

Despite it's innocent looking apex which just seems to be a small buff, the increase in its killing capability puts this apex on par with many of the higher level speedrunning ships in armor missions. The capability of MS to kill off Ravens much faster also entails a higher survivability, since these Ravens can pump in so many MIRVs on field quickly if not disposed of, making Prime X significantly easier to use.
