# Saber

> It refers to the shape of the Swiss Army Knife, but it is not as versatile as that.

## Comments

- 圆锥曲线: I'd like to see Saber and Antioch fxxk each other.

## Survival

- Saber has actually 2 means to clear out bullets from its Aura and Zen.
- In daily missions, REMP can be used defensively since VL does most of the job to keep the field clean. VL will sweep the field first, and the remaining invaders with their bullets can be dealt with using REMP.
- For the purpose of survivability, it's best to use REMP defensively, except maybe the first wave of an Act where there is transition time to allow you to dodge the remaining bullets of the last Act.
- If REMP is still in the midst of cooling down, VL can be used to get you out. You will have to push forward with the VL to take advantage of its Vorpal Wake.
- If there aren't a lot of Ravens on field (mostly in community and specialist missions), then VL can be instead converted to taking out dangerous turrets such as spinners or MIRV Bloomers.
- For waves with Eagles, throw your VLs against them, waiting for either the Eagles to line up, or for Ravens behind to line up with the Eagles. It is important to take out these Eagles as soon as possible. Try to have the Eagles line up so that 3 VLs will vaporize them immediately.
- Lasers are once again not a big problem for Saber due to its VL which can rapidly take out at least half of the screen before Ravens can fire their lasers. Always aim to take out Ravens immediately once they enter the screen to reduce the chance of them moving apart for a less ideal VL strike.

## Speedrun

- With its double AoE damage, Saber wipes crowds extremely quickly.
- REMP is generally used against Ravens as a wave opener.
- Saber is one of the ships that absolutely requires prior planning for when to use VL or REMP for best optimization since VL and REMP are competing AoE damage means which must be carefully allocated.
- It is very tempting to use REMP as a wave opener as with many other ships with REMP. Unfortunately, it is not always optimal to do so. You must analyze if a wave actually requires REMP. If using REMP does not result in less amounts of main bursts being used, there is no point to use REMP.
- As a guide, the main of Saber can take out 2 Ravens in one burst. Thus, in early waves with 2 or 4 Ravens, there is simply no point in using REMP. In contrast, if these Ravens are mixed with other invaders, it may be worthwhile to use REMP.
- It is usually a good idea to just run through the mission with Saber, using REMP only as defence and positional tool to land your main properly. Note down which waves can be done faster with REMP.
- With waves that have many Sparrows, REMP is for sure worthwhile to use due to the fact that the main that can be difficult in aiming at Sparrows.
- In daily missions, it's quite rare to use REMP since VL does most of the job. REMP is usually only used at the start of each Act, and perhaps the start of a heavier wave mid-Act.
- One of the best combinations to use, especially in a heavy (and perhaps dense) wave is to use VL in the middle of the field, ride up with the VL, then immediately charge an REMP. This ensures you a very safe offensive REMP.

## Fun

- With a double AoE damage, Saber is a ton of fun.
- Saber's main is annoying since its projectiles come out angled towards the center of the ship. (The left right alternating is not much of an issue here, it's more of the angle) Coupled with only minor homing, it can be very frustrating to hit Sparrows.
- Saber's reactor positioning is a little strange.

## Trivia

- Saber was only introduced into Phoenix 2 at v2.1.
- A 3D perspective of Saber used to be featured in some of Phoenix 2's promotional posters, and is also in the cover banner of the old web version of the Phoenix 2 Reddit.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_51_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Extended Range
- Type: Zen
- Description: Improved amplifiers increase the EMP range.
- Interpretation: The max range increases from 225 to 280.
- Form: Epsilon
- Price: 25000
- Score: 3.00 / 5

This apex gives Saber much more viability in more bullet heavy missions, with the extended range of bullet clearance not only allowing it to survive better, but to also have more horizontal space to launch VLs between wave transitions. It does also help to catch a bit more invaders in its REMP for damage on occasion. This apex, when utilized well, can be extremely powerful and can snatch BoBs on some much harder daily missions.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_51_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: High Capacity
- Type: Aura
- Description: Vorpal Lance can store more energy, adding an additional Counter.
- Interpretation: The max volume increases from 4 to 5.
- Form: Beta
- Price: 10000
- Score: 2.82 / 5

The double AoE damage means of Saber means that REMP can sometimes clean up too much, especially when it comes to Sparrow crowds. This can lead to a very quick build-up of VLs, which runs the risk of wasting particles, especially in daily missions where waves can get very dense. This apex alleviates that.
