## Comments

- Dark骑士: It has a double laser main weapon and one of its APEXes are also a double laser. Although its appearance in high leagues is not high, it has a lot of room for use in community missions. It is the easiest to use among the Full Offense ships. The APEX is very cost-effective, and can also be used as a preparation for Kibarrax.

## Trivia

- Never think of it as three candles, especially the base form.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_34_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Ion Warheads
- Type: Aura
- Description: Missiles equipped with Ion charges stun turrets on impact.
- Interpretation: Missiles stun the turrets within 50 range for 0.6s.
- Form: Sigma
- Price: 35000
- Score: 3.82 / 5

This APEX is for EX to enhance survivability. A complete set of missiles can continuously stun enemy turrets, which means that those threatening turrets can not attack even once. This is good news for this offense-oriented ship, which can perform more output in a safer range. It also gives it a stronger ability to survive in missions with extremely dense bullets, allowing it to compete with other ships.
