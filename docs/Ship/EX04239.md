## Comments

- Dark骑士: It has a double laser main weapon and one of its APEXes are also a double laser. Although its appearance in high leagues is not high, it has a lot of room for use in community missions. It is the easiest to use among the Full Offense ships. The APEX is very cost-effective, and can also be used as a preparation for Kibarrax.

## Survival

- No defense other than ML. Plus ML is no reliable defence, especially in General/Boomerang missions where they are fast bullets and lasers.
- Ex0's only defence is it's extreme speed, which can be difficult to master.

## Speedrun

- There's no contest that Ex0 is the among the fastest among all AP ships. The highest DPS in its class, together with 2 extreme burst damage from both MS and ML, means this ship takes out almost all invaders with ease given you have the capability to dodge through some amount of bullets. The thing is, you don't even have to worry about bullets filling the screen because you kill so fast, there's just no chance for the invaders to pump in bullets to kill you.
- A half full MS and an ML kills a Vulture instantly. Thus a good idea is to push forward with the ML in order to allow the MS to lock on to invaders behind the Vulture so that the DPS is not wasted.
- Most of the time, for the most optimal time, you would be charging ML at the very bottom of the screen at the start of every wave. This is of course not always possible due to fast moving darts. When you are faced with a wave that has a frontline, remember to centralize yourself so that the released ML hits the Vulture's cockpit to bypass armor damage reduction. Only fire MS when nearer to the Vulture to allow MS time to lock on to the invaders behind. Try not to be too near otherwise too many missiles will hit the Vulture and might be wasted overkill.
- In fact, it is almost always a good idea to push forward with the ML fired, as it allows you to collect particles and immediately launch an MS from the dead invaders. Of course, remember to launch your MS immediately after you fire ML if you already have full Aura so that you do not waste particles.
- The only exception to the above is probably when there aren't much residual particles in front and all the invaders on field have very high health, like Eagles in front, and then a Vulture behind it.
- Ex0's bursty main nature is extremely consistent, and thus properly optimized, can leak nearly ZERO damage. You can do a medium speed sweep in early waves that have Sparrows. While 4 sparrows on screen can possibly be completely destroyed with one proper sweep, it usually takes 2 sweeps. You should aim for only one sweep if it's only 3 sparrows.
- While Ex0's main is a bursty main and you CAN charge ML just as the main fires, it is an extremely rare occasion to be able to do so, since Ex0 kills so fast you won't even have time for that (and you would instead waste more time since you could had used MS, and the ML cooldown would stack). But keep in mind it can be possible, so use this technique where deemed fit.
- You would see a lot of pro players apparently charging ML just to cancel it afterwards very quickly. Why? This is to reset Ex0's bursty main. Just as the last invader from the previous wave is cleared, let go. Then when the next wave of invaders arrive fully, engage touch again and the next burst immediately fires again. You do not waste the burst recharge time or risk part of the next burst doing no damage.
- Unfortunately, in daily missions, while Ex0 is still a fast ship, it possesses only raw firepower with no means of AoE damage. This means it will take some time for Ex0 to chew through very dense waves. Some Aura is even wasted since the next MS cannot reload fast enough before the previous MS finds their targets. In that regard, because Ex0 eliminates from front to back, this gives a chance for behind invaders to flood the field with bullets, spelling trouble for Ex0.
- In the lower ranks, Ex0 can still take the top spots in Armored missions and even first since players in lower ranks usually aren't as skilled to handle its competitor ships such as Saber and Wraith well enough.

## Fun

- Speedrunning with Ex0 is probably the most enjoyable among all the other speedrunners due to its extreme consistency. Very little RNG is involved due to a consistent main, Aura and Zen. There still can be small issues due to invader movements, but it happens for every ship that does not have a homing or tracking weapon anyway. (And you can't expect the highest DPS in the game to have a homing or tracking main, it's just not fair)
- Even if you are not really into speedrunning, the pure speed that stems from its DPS, Aura and Zen is extremely satisfying, even if you choose to take it quite slow. You could always destroy most of the wave very fast and then slow down at the end to let the bullets cool off before proceeding to the next wave.
- As with many speedrunning ships, instantly vaporizing a frontline Vulture is very satisfying.

## Trivia

- Never think of it as three candles, especially the base form.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_34_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Ion Warheads
- Type: Aura
- Description: Missiles equipped with Ion charges stun turrets on impact.
- Interpretation: Missiles stun the turrets within 50 range for 0.6s.
- Form: Sigma
- Price: 35000
- Score: 3.82 / 5

This APEX is for EX to enhance survivability. A complete set of missiles can continuously stun enemy turrets, which means that those threatening turrets can not attack even once. This is good news for this offense-oriented ship, which can perform more output in a safer range. It also gives it a stronger ability to survive in missions with extremely dense bullets, allowing it to compete with other ships.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_34_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Twin Laser
- Type: Zen
- Description: Heavily modified Meson Projectors can shoot two Mega Laser beams side by side.
- Interpretation: Two 100-damage lasers will be fired at the same time with a gap in between.
- Form: Phi
- Price: 45000
- Score: 3.55 / 5

This apex fires 2 MLs side-by-side, with a tiny gap in the middle. The damage from both MLs add up to 200 damage.

This simultaneous ML enables Ex04239 to take out 2 Vulture turrets side by side, and that's pretty much about it, giving it just slightly more survivability. However, this function is rarely used as many speedrunning players will instead force the full 200 damage on the cockpit of Vultures to go even faster than its Sigma Apex. However, due to the difficulty in manuveuring Ex04239 through bullets to target its main or even MS properly, this apex is still too difficult to use, like base Ex04239. The best of best players, however, will pilot this apex even faster than the Sigma Apex in easier missions.
