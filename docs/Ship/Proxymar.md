## Comments

- 弃坑中: Perfect normal attack, perfect experience of playing, perfect feel of speedrun, it's a pity that it hasn't Armor Piercing missiles like Kibarrax.

## Survival

- Low DPS, and absolutely no defence at all. Once trapped, you are dead.

## Speedrun

- MS and MB are used in alternate turns, and the main helps out a bit in the damage, although the main damage comes from MS and MB. The lack of bullets in such laser missions is what makes Proxymar so strong as bullets are its biggest enemies. In fact, MB can be used every medium wave or above.
- Positioning is of utmost key, ironically (in a instant tracking main), as MB positioning plays a real part in cutting off precious milliseconds to jump a few places. Also, the positioning ensures you don't get killed easily by invaders crashing into you.
- The pace is so fast that MB cooldown actually starts to play a real factor in speed, and there is actually a need to optimize the pace such that the MB cooldown doesn't become so long. Bear in mind that all zens have an exponential cooldown which steeply drops towards the end.
- Do not use MB in light waves. Simply use a full size MS to eliminate them all. Once that MS fires, start charging MB for the next wave.
- When dealing with pellet spinners, it can be a good idea to perform the spinner riding technique to gain free Aura. However, bear in mind this can hurt your positioning in the next wave. It may thus be better if you can simply kill the entire invader(s) with the pellet spinners before it can start firing. This can be done by reserving particles.
- Proxymar requires a lot of approximation. In particular, you must know for the size of MS, how long you have to wait to launch it such that the MS will clear the entire remainder of the wave. This is important for speed as you should be charging MB right after MS fires to save time in the next wave, particularly when MB charge times can get rather long due to how fast Proxymar can be.
- However, for maximum optimization of MS at the end of the wave, you have to continue firing your main for a while more, charging MB such that MB has just nice completed charging as the next wave has arrived.
- In fact, under the best circumstances (where there are very few bigger invaders), Proxymar is able to clinch a sub 1 minute (I'm not kidding, it has happened recently on S4 daily #1092, which is 28th December 2018). This is sadly no longer possible in the new v5.0 daily mission layout.

## Fun

- Proxymar is one of the easiest FO ships to pick up due to the lack of need to aim. Plus going really fast is really fun, particularly when there are very little bullets to worry about.

## Trivia

- Proxymar was one of the most overpowered ships way back in v1.0, since both MS and MB were overpowered. It still is on (most) laser missions today.
- Proxymar was one of the most heavily spammed ships in past Shielded Laser/Pellet missions before v5.0. Practically, every single time this mission comes by, the S+ leagues were always flooded with Proxymars. It got so bad that what it feels like the top 300 places in the S4 leagues were almost purely Proxymars. The only exception where Proxymar didn't dominate was when there was a difficult Roc with tracking lasers and pellet spinners, which was rare before v5.0. Today, however, Proxymar is mostly out of meta but still sees some use in Laser/Pellet missions in some of the top spots, although generally about less than 20 players play it.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_13_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Extended Range
- Type: Zen
- Description: More potent energy particles increase the blast range.
- Interpretation: The max radius increases from 400 to 500.
- Form: Delta
- Price: 20000
- Score: 3.18 / 5

This apex helps Proxymar to charge at an extreme corner of the field and still be able to catch more invaders, especially in harder missions such as Pellet/Shuriken/Laser missions. This, however, still puts Proxymar at great risk from dying from being overwhelmed from so many bullets in such missions.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_13_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: EMP Core
- Type: Zen
- Description: Fusion Core also destroys enemy bullets.
- Interpretation: The bullets within a range of 100 will be cleared.
- Form: Beta
- Price: 10000
- Score: 1.73 / 5

This apex can help Proxymar in slightly bullet heavier laser missions such as Laser/Pellet and Pellet/Shuriken/Laser missions to create more breathing space to escape the mess of bullets after charging MB.
