## Survival

- Barrier is the only defensive option. You have to utilize the inner-lining in order to block off a mass of bullets.
- The Reflector Apex makes Stinger viable in laser missions, increasing damage output as well as improving survivability. 
- Quantum Repeaters has a consistent fire rate with no burst damage. Sometimes you need to couple it with FL to prioritize eliminating turrets. 

## Speedrun

- With no other means of dealing burst damage, FL should be fully optimized when speed-running in bullet-heavy missions.
- In laser-heavy missions, Barriers with the Reflector Apex can be used to deal extra damage.

## Fun

- Watching invaders die one by one is satisfying.
- The main weapon’s continuous damage outputting gives you the pleasant sensation of killing invaders non-stop.


## Trivia

- Stinger is one of the only 3 ships with fans constantly spinning (Oran, Stinger, Tillat'Or).
- Disaris wake up and stand for a while.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_93_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Expert Focus
- Type: Zen
- Description: Launches Focus Lance even faster and recovers it more quickly.
- Interpretation: The charge time decreases from 0.35s to 0.25s, the recovery time decreases from 4.5s to 3.5s.
- Form: Lambda
- Price: 30000
- Score: 2.73 / 5

With this Apex, you can spam FL even more. This is beneficial because you can now use it twice per wave. However, most of the time, the charge time recovery for normal FL is already sufficient, which allows you to use it to deal extra damage quite frequently even without this Apex.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_93_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Reflector
- Type: Aura
- Description: Laser reflect on the Barrier outer surface.
- Interpretation: Laser will be reflected to invaders with 10 damage per second.
- Form: Epsilon
- Price: 25000
- Score: 4.45 / 5

As the most powerful upgrade to Barrier, Reflector Apex brings more playability to Stinger because of the extra damage potential in laser missions. Since Stinger’s offensive means are relatively simple, with this Apex, you can now focus more on the placement of Barriers.
