## Survival

- In Daily Missions, IC is not going anywhere due to how dense waves can get frequently. However, in heavier waves, Xavis will still stand a chance. Despite that, the lack of large enough means of AoE attack put this ship at a several disadvantage.
- Although FL can be used at the start of the wave, the amount of Ravens that can be cleared out is only that many. The rest of the invaders have to be then be taken out with the main, or with the lackluster damage of IC.
- There is almost no chance for Xavis to use FL again in a wave, especially when you become more focused on dodging than actually getting damage off.
- In front heavy waves (Eagles, Vulture or Condor) however, Xavis may actually work after throwing an IC or 2 to stun the frontline invaders.
- All of Xavis mechanisms are forward firing. This means that dealing with invaders that is not ahead of it is difficult.
- Thus, navigating sideways is a very big problem for Xavis. Couple that with the fact that Xavis attack means are not very powerful, it means that you can easily get stuck in a mess of bullets headed your way.
- The difficulty in navigating sideways for Xavis is what makes it tremendously weak to lasers since it cannot strafe effectively to avoid them.
- Xavis main is also difficult to handle. The zig-zag pattern of Xavis makes it very difficult to control it properly in order to pop off turrets. This is made even worse by the fact that bursts fire at alternating sides, making it all the more confusing for turret popping.
- The zig-zag main can be somewhat alleviated by moving against the direction of the zig-zag to make the projectiles seem to fire in a straight line. Once again, the difficulty of navigating Xavis makes this very difficult, and it is difficult to figure out the zig-zag to counter it.

## Speedrun

- While FL provides some AoE damage, its limited usage doesn't make Xavis very fast.
- IC, while it does provide some AoE damage, it is hard to have it effect many invaders due to how small the AoE is. The small damage of IC is unable to give it a lot of speed.

## Fun

- A frustrating main which apparently sprays all over the place, this ship can get pretty frustrating to use.
- At least, the main looks like fireworks, and kind of sounds like fireworks when it hits invaders too.

## Trivia

- Xavis was only introduced into Phoenix 2 at v5.0.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_85_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Overcharge
- Type: Aura
- Description: Overcharged Ion Cannon stuns targets in a larger area.
- Interpretation: The blast radius increases from 50 to 115.
- Form: Alpha
- Price: 5000
- Score: 1.82 / 5

The capability to stun many turrets make this apex very powerful. This is especially so when Xavis is weak to lasers due to the fact its strictly forward firing mechanism make navigation very difficult, often getting stuck underneath dart streams and other bullets. You no longer need to worry whether you hit the correct invader that contains laser turrets, just throw and forget. The density of invaders mean a high probability IC hits something, which then stun resets the laser turrets. The brief 1s is enough to clear enough space for you to jump to another side of the field, in order to fire off more ICs to repeat the process. You now only need to deal with the upfield invaders, where you have more time to figure out the bullet patterns for navigation.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_85_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Blast Amplifier
- Type: Aura
- Description: Blast radius and damage of the Ion Cannon projectiles are increased.
- Interpretation: The blast radius increases from 50 to 100, the damage increases from 10 to 13.
- Form: Gamma
- Price: 15000
- Score: 3.27 / 5

In the extremely dense composition of waves, this apex gives Xavis some viability in plowing through invaders to reach the more dangerous ones, particularly those that carry high tier boomerang or MIRV turrets. However, it requires several ICs to be fired just to destroy a sizeable amount of invaders to create breathing space. It also does not fix the inherent weakness of Xavis, it only possessing forward firing mechanisms (All 3 attributes, Main, Aura and Zen) thus still making Xavis Gamma difficult to pilot, although the blast radius increase alleviates this problem slightly.
