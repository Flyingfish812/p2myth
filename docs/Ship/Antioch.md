## Comments

- No2oMe: Sometimes the only way to stop the main weapon from wobbling all over the place is to go full face-hug… but that’s a death wish against shuriken-spammers, especially that shuriken sparrow at the start. Honestly, this ship's a pain to use in missions with spammy patterns.
- No2oMe: If you treat it purely as a straightforward frontal assault ship, it actually becomes surprisingly powerful.
- 莱: Every time I play this ship, it feels like watching a drunk battleship trying its best to walk in a straight line—clumsy, determined, and destined for glorious failure.
