## Survival

- Antioch has a very difficult to handle main weapon. Its main weapon is slightly tracking which can throw off your aim, especially when you are very near to 2 points which can be targeted (Such points include turrets, cockpits and even the sides of a Vulture or bigger invader).
- Thus, in order to minimize the main's wonky targeting, it is high recommended that ironically, you do not line up yourself with smaller invaders such as Herons and below. Instead, aim slightly left or right of them. The main will then track the outermost turret and you can then move a bit closer to hit the invader. However, in heavy and/or dense waves, this does not matter since invaders are literally everywhere.
- Because of this wonky main targeting nature, it is difficult to target inner turrets of larger invaders, Vulture and above. This is not too much an issue for Vultures since the outermost turrets are usually the more dangerous ones, but in a Condor, this can spell disaster as the front middle turrets are usually quite deadly.
- The slightly good thing about the wonky main is the fact that killing Sparrows can be easier in some cases. This is especially so for Sparrows that spew out continuous, non-ending dart streams. Simply go up to them, but due to the slight tracking, you can safely offset a bit to kill them.
- For waves with the near absence of lasers, PS can be used as a tool to get yourself out of a mess of bullets. However, when trapped between darts, this is very difficult due to their speed, and PS still requires some time to charge. Anticipation is needed and this is not easy to pull off.
- VL should also be used to snipe down dangerous turrets, such as MIRV Spreads.
- PS is quite effective against MIRV Spreads, as you can use Phase Out to plow your way through the released pellets. However, this only be done once per wave so be sure to eliminate these MIRV turrets fast.
- PS can also be used against boomerangs, blocking off the boomerangs first, and then using Phase Out to eliminate the rest of the pellets released by MIRVs. However, you will need to be fast in eliminating either boomerang turrets or MIRV turrets as having both around will quickly result in being overwhelmed.

## Speedrun

- VL means Antioch can wipe very fast by doing lance sweeps. The need to move around quite a lot to re-adjust the aiming of your main is strong justification to do lance sweeps.
- PS is also used to reflect lasers, adding to its speedrunning capability.
- It is also desirable to use PS Phase Out in waves that do not feature lasers to quickly switch targets, and to also accommodate for aligning yourself appropriately to hit the main on smaller invaders. It is of essence to eliminate smaller targets by the main quickly to allow more breathing space if VLs are not available.

## Fun

- The main is very annoying to deal with. Sometimes when shooting invaders, for no reason the main will suddenly veer off to the other side because it thinks the other target point is nearer. This is due to invader random movement.
- VL is fun to use for sure, and with Antioch's need to reposition yourself frequently, there is strong justification to do lance sweeps.
- PS is also a fun tool in its mission type to reflect lasers.

## Trivia

- Antioch was only introduced into Phoenix 2 at v2.5.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_62_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Twin Lance
- Type: Aura
- Description: Split Vorpal Lance into two projectiles for a larger surface area.
- Interpretation: The surface area is doubled.
- Form: Delta
- Price: 20000
- Score: 4.18 / 5

This apex is really fun! Because of the wider VL, it is significantly easier to catch pesky Ravens that run all over the screen, leading to much less frustration, especially when Antioch’s main can be very wonky. This means that if you kill fast enough and continuously grab particles to refill VLs, the main now takes a backseat in simply being support to kill off the larger invaders, which is a huge relief since it can be difficult to control the main. This means potentially saving tons of VLs, and killing invaders extremely fast in crowded days like today. Particularly, lance sweeps are a breeze, since you only need to use 3 VLs to cover the entire width of the screen. It is quite easy to overfill on VLs due to the need to use less of them. While not showcased due to the insane speed of killing invaders, the wider VL also serves as a much better form of defence for Antioch since it does not have much defence other than PS which is exhausted very quickly and is only a one-time use per wave.

## APEX 2

- Name: High Capacity
- Type: Aura
- Description: Vorpal Lance can store more energy, adding an additional Counter.
- Interpretation: The max volume increases from 4 to 5.
- Form: Beta
- Price: 10000
- Score: 2.82 / 5

This apex is good for the extra push that you require on certain waves that are extremely dangerous, particularly, those that are MIRV heavy. You would then stockpile on VLs in the previous wave or 2, so that you will reach the full 5 VLs, capable of wiping out even the toughest invaders discounting Vultures and above. Otherwise, it only helps very slightly for speedrunning, as there are rarely consecutive waves where VL just isn't necessary and you can fill slightly beyond 4 VLs to push for a better time in other waves ahead.
