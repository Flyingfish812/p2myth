## Survival

- This ship can be anywhere it wants to be. A combination of TP as well as a homing main allows this ship continue to deal damage even though it needs to TP out of a spot to escape a bullet mess.
- It's generally better to stay somewhere nearer to the bottom of the screen however, since spread turrets may make it difficult to dodge their bullets. In addition, DDMB may also deny you from being upfield.
- That being said, if you find a need to be upfield, by all means go ahead.
- You may find yourself TP-ing a few times in a wave especially when it is a heavy wave, so be careful of the build-up of charge time.
- GMs should be fired as the wave arrives (and not when the wave has fully arrived) so that they would hit with a higher probability.

## Speedrun

- For maximum effect, as the ship class implies, dive right into the center of the field by TP-ing right in the face of invaders and throw a GM right into the thick of the mess. This maximizes the GM's AoE damage.
- After firing the GMs, quickly extract yourself by swiping downwards to the bottom of the screen.
- However, the weak DPS of the main means Claymore is not exactly that fast.
- Since invader movement can be quite random, there can be a bit of speedrunning inconsistencies from catching a few more invaders or not.

## Fun

- Having the absolute freedom to be anywhere you want, even when stuck at a corner (just TP away) makes this ship easy to play.
- However, if you like it more exciting, then TP into the thick of the action and blast some GMs into the invaders' faces to obliterate them rather quickly.

## Trivia

- Claymore was only introduced into Phoenix 2 at v5.0.
- Claymore was based off one of the submitted ship drawings by a fan of Phoenix 2.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_86_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Disintegrator Warhead
- Type: Aura
- Description: Destroys enemy bullets caught in the blast.
- Interpretation: Clears all the bullets within the blast radius of about 150.
- Form: Lambda
- Price: 30000
- Score: 3.82 / 5

Love to go right up to the invaders’ face? This apex is for you. The ability of GM to clear bullets in its blast radius is perfect for close encounters, where you no longer have to worry about the split second moments where invaders are still able to fire their bullets at you and unexpectedly killing you. This enhances Claymore’s playstyle of TP-ing right into the thick of the mess to immediately launch a GM. The bullet clear capability also wipes out clusters of MIRVs and lanes of boomerangs, and even pellets that were released from MIRVs with lethal efficiency. TP also makes the timing of bullet clearing more precise and predictable.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_86_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Extended Clearance
- Type: Zen
- Description: Energy from the Teleport is released on arrival to extended the range of the Arrival EMP.
- Interpretation: The clearing space increases from 50 to 80.
- Form: Delta
- Price: 20000
- Score: 1.55 / 5

The increase in clearance space allows you to take slightly higher risks in going in for the kill when TP-ing in to launch GMs. Otherwise, it is only a tiny buff which doesn’t change the playstyle of Claymore. Unlike its Lambda Apex, the effect is immediate upon arrival of TP, rather than needing to account for GM travel time for bullet clearance, which makes it slightly easier for less skilled players. The result is the clearance space is smaller for the Delta Apex.
