## Survival

- Lyova's double AoE bullet capabilities keep it alive for really long. Being able to alternate between using both means of bullet clearing makes Lyova so survivable.
- BEMP is your primary means of getting yourself out of being cornered. Use it only when it is big enough (approximately slightly less than half of your screen's horizontal space in terms of diameter). If it's too small, BEMP just isn't useful and you should use REMP instead.
- Bigger BEMPs facilitate the aiming of your main. The main is highly damaging but also very directed so you need navigation space.
- Lyova's main is excellent for turret popping. 2 bursts of the main (both sides of the burst hitting the turret) makes quick work of dangerous turrets. A BEMP can be used to quickly change over to the other dangerous turret on the other side of the Vulture.
- You need to go on the offense when you see mass clusters of Ravens in front and use REMP to severely weaken them.
- Be careful to conserve your BEMP if you are expecting the next wave to have larger invaders in front, and use REMP to clean up the previous wave's bullets.
- You can then use BEMP to counter bullets from the larger invaders FIRST, before resorting to REMP later.
- When faced with Rocs, use your BEMP and REMP to position yourself such that the very thin main weapon penetrates into the behind turrets to take out these very dangerous spinners or bloomers. Do this as quickly as possible otherwise you will get overwhelmed. The front turrets can be dealt with later.
- Don't be afraid to go inbetween clusters of MIRVs to launch a BEMP, so long you do it quickly.
- In MIRV/Shuriken missions, REMP is primarily a defence tool, used interchangeably with BEMP. In General/Boomerang missions however, REMP is a wave opener as well. It can also be used mid-wave for defence.

## Speedrun

- REMP gives it a slight bit of speed, which regulated carefully enough, can go a bit faster.
- A small BEMP can be used to get into a better position for an REMP to follow up immediately for some AoE damage.

## Fun

- The main makes a rather satisfying sound.
- The double means of bullet clearing is very satisfying.
- The damage dealt by REMP to Ravens is also satisfying, although REMP is generally used more defensively.

## Trivia

- Lyova was only introduced into Phoenix 2 at v3.6.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_77_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: High Damage
- Type: Zen
- Description: Energy actuators increase the damage of the EMP.
- Interpretation: The damage increases from 20 to 30.
- Form: Lambda
- Price: 30000
- Score: 4.91 / 5

The capability to instantly blow up Ravens with an REMP is immensely satisfying with this apex. This is especially in dense waves. However, Sparrows still prove to be quite a trouble sometimes to chase down with its thin main. Particle overflow is still very likely and you should not be afraid to abuse BEMP to reposition yourself appropriately. The inability to deal against Sparrows at times make this Lambda Apex inferior to the Tau Apex which takes care of both Ravens and Sparrows.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_77_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Destructive Wave
- Type: Aura
- Description: An Enhanced Bullet EMP that also deals damage to Invaders.
- Interpretation: Bullet EMP deals at most 10 damage to invaders within range.
- Form: Tau
- Price: 40000
- Score: 4.64 / 5

A very powerful apex, the usage of BEMP + REMP together completely devastates Raven crowds. Just be careful to let REMP cooldown sufficiently before heading into the next wave otherwise there will be too much handle, as shown by me intentionally delaying 5-1 to allow REMP to cool for 5-2, which would be impossible without using REMP for damage. Some waves also require for BEMP to be delayed slightly so that you can buy a bit more time to destroy some of the invaders.
