## Comments

- Dark骑士: This ship with a strong Japanese cultural color of is also one of the first ships to be discovered by speedrun players. Its main weapon is highly recognizable. It is neither a projectile nor a light. Its real-time tracking characteristics are the only one. Both the attack method and the aura tend to change the game mechanics. Its aura reminds me of scenes in anime: Domain expansion - Fukuma Mizushi.
- Dark骑士: Although the real-time tracking main weapon looks awesome, if it just looks awesome, it will not become regular on the leaderboard. The biggest advantage of the Shogun is that the main weapon does not need to change its position in order to hit the turret. This is equivalent to saying that the Shogun has the largest activity space while ensuring its own output in advance. For speedrun players, what they consider is how to convert the space into output. The answer is to graze. It can be said that the Shogun is a grazer. It is also the one that best embodies the game's concept of "turning defense into offense".
- Kite Runner: Shogun can hardly beat other speedrun ships in medium and low-density bullets. If you want to gain an advantage in speedrun, you must have a dense bullet and continuously graze to charge the aura. In addition to experiences and skills, it is also necessary to break the conventional thinking and use more inhuman operations, and survive after death. It can be said that you cannot control it unless you are a master.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_68_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: High Damage
- Type: Zen

- Interpretation: The damage increases from 20 to 30.
- Form: Sigma
- Price: 35000

Shogun's ultimate form, which is even more powerful than the other APEX that focuses on grazing bullets. The reason is that the more difficult the mission, the more bullets there are, and when the amount of bullets increases, the effectiveness of grazing has nothing to do with whether to use APEX. In addition, denser bullets also mean that you can't dodge the bullets leisurely, and you need to consider how to destroy the invaders efficiently. Therefore, a high-damage Reflex EMP coupled with a full aura is enough to kill most invaders in a wave. It is indeed more effective than getting a little more aura size by grazing. The final point is that sometimes an extra 10 points of damage (7 points in armor missions) can make a qualitative difference. As the saying goes, it's better to cut off one of the enemy's ten fingers than to injure them. You don't want to leave a lot of invaders with little health on the screen, right?
