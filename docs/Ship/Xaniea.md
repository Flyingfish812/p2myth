## Survival

- While Xaniea does rely on killing fast, it has TP, it's saving grace in times of being threatened.
- TP does occasionally help in allowing LS to reach a target if you require to kill something really urgently but don't have a big size Aura.
- Unfortunately, Xaniea's wide spread means that it is unable to focus fire, thus turret popping is very difficult, making taking out boomerangs difficult. LS does cover this flaw slightly, but due to the nature of LS to switch targets rather quickly, it's not entirely reliable.
- What you can do to partially overcome this flaw of turret popping is to deploy LS first, and then go point blank to the turret you want to pop off. When the dangerous turret fires, retreat. This is however, difficult if there are dart tracking turrets around.
- Because lasers in General/Boomerang missions can track rather fast, TP is also a means to escape these lasers by TP-ing to the opposite side. This is natural as you would start off a wave a bit more upfield and then retreat towards the bottom of the screen. Just offset slightly to one side so that not too much DPS is being lost.

## Speedrun

- The rather high damaging main, coupled with an offensive aura, means it can go reasonably fast.
- At the start of a wave, TP forward. You can then retreat downwards if there are dart spread turrets. Otherwise, you can stay up there until the shuriken launchers or MIRV Bloomers fire. This allows you not to only maximize the main, but also potentially pop off turrets. If the turrets are boomerangs, that's even better because they will curve around you.
- Unfortunately, since many waves are dense and feature many turrets with sometimes varying types, it is often only possible to TP just slightly in front of invaders, not exactly at point blank range and then retreat downwards. Going point blank will put you at danger with dart turrets that appear quite frequently.

## Fun

- LS is pretty aesthetically pleasing and has pretty satisfying sounds to couple with it.
- Together with the rather aesthetically pleasing main weapon, it is a visually appealing ship to play. Unfortunately, this also means that the visuals of the ship's offensive means do get in the way of trying to survive.

## Trivia

- The shape of its projectiles are very similar to that of the ship.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_30_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Explosive Arrival
- Type: Zen
- Description: Arrival EMP has been modulated to also deal damage to Invaders in its range.
- Interpretation: Deals 30 damage to Invaders within a range of 50 from the arrival point.
- Form: Lambda
- Price: 30000
- Score: 4.27 / 5

This apex is powerful. It will take out troublesome Ravens hiding all the way upfield which can easily cause issues when equipped with laser turrets. Explosive TP goes in for the initial damage, and LS then cleans up quickly after the initial damage, killing them near instantly. Abusing TP when faced with Raven crowds is very desirable, just remember to activate LS before you start your massacre. The main also plays a great part during the initial phase of any wave. Simply flood the field with your Photon Pods when the wave fully arrives, activate LS, and then start your massacre. This makes LS and the main synergise with Explosive TP very well as the weak DPS from LS or the weak damage from each individual Photon Pod is just enough to destroy a Raven after the Explosive TP. Because of the abuse of TP for Ravens, it is generally not used much on larger invaders, Eagles and above. However, it can still be used for some extra damage on bigger invaders, although it’s generally better to let TP cool down, unless it’s a wave with only larger invaders.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_30_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Shield Breaker
- Type: Aura
- Description: Laser Moon type S deals extra damage to shields.
- Interpretation: Lasers deal 2.5x damage to shields.
- Form: Tau
- Price: 40000
- Score: 3.09 / 5

Despite Xaniea’s AP weapon type, SB LS is powerful enough to rip the shields of invaders off very quickly, and then the main can go to work in taking down the unshielded invaders, which won’t take very long. Because General and General/Dart missions feature a pretty heavy dart hell, you can keep spamming LS and still regain them quickly. LS is able to keep up almost all the time. However, lasers are a great downfall for Xaniea since you must be very careful which dart / pellet lane you choose, otherwise you’ll end getting diced by the lasers. Otherwise, this apex is actually a pretty fun apex for a fun ship, allowing you to take Xaniea out for a ride in Shield missions as well.

If anything, Xaniea Tau is one of the most aesthetically pleasing apex to play, with a combination of green pods from its main, blue LS from SB LS, yellow/golden from the Aura radius, as well as red from the bullets and lasers on screen. Playing this ship feels like mixing everything together on a color palette, especially if you do so on a dark background such as in Gau Prime or Arcology CQ-6. Aesthetics alone can simply justify buying this apex for a great visual and gameplay experience.
