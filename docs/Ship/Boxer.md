## Survival

- Despite the short main burst with a somewhat long interval, Boxer's main actually feels quite weak. It improves a bit with crits but it doesn't quite feel enough to punch through invaders quickly.
- Thankfully, Boxer's defensive measures are pretty powerful. They also work very well together.
- Phalanx is used for Boxer's navigation around the field in order to strike down invaders.
- Destroy invaders column by column before moving to the next one. If you need to clear bullets, do a forward shovel and then retreat to the bottom of the field.
- When you need to move to the next column, use a diagonal shovel.
- However, once in a while, you can also pop in an REMP after shoveling. When using REMP, do not head back down to the bottom of the field.
- The resulting REMP will not only clear a large portion of the field, but can catch a few invaders to deal damage to them.
- In General/Boomerang missions, shoveling forward can allow you to dodge boomerangs completely.
- However, it is difficult to use REMP as an offence, and REMP is usually used more defensively and separately from Phalanx, turning Boxer into a more of a Double Defence ship. REMPs are usually used at the bottom of the screen whenever possible.

## Speedrun

- Because Boxer's main is considered pretty thin, it is difficult to hit invaders, especially when bullets are everywhere.
- There are times when it is too difficult to move to the other side of the field when you are done with clearing invaders on one side of the field because the other side continues to pump in MIRVs.
- The only solution to this is to wait until REMP is ready to fire, and then charge REMP in the middle of the field to clear enough space on the other side to proceed to that side of the field. This wastes a few bursts of the main.

## Fun

- Boxer's powerful bullet clearing capabilities is very satisfying. Particularly, pulling off a Phalanx shovel to the middle of the field and then releasing REMP and clearing nearly the whole field of red is very satisfying.

## Trivia

- Boxer was only introduced into Phoenix 2 at v2.2.

- Name: Smart Fire
- Type: Main Weapon

- Price: 10000
- Score: 2.36 / 5

This apex which makes the 3 Flash Cutters completely independent of each other, each of them only firing when there is a target point in front of it. Essentially, this turns its main weapon into a Cone Triggered - Independent Type.

It makes Boxer leak less damage, however, you might need to adjust your playstyle quite a lot. In particular, because of how difficult is it to estimate when the next burst of each of the 3 flash cutters are going to fire, sitting right under a turret or invader hoping that something will fire is impractical. Instead, you need to shake from side to side, with the target you want to hit in the center of your oscillating movement, so that when any one of the 3 flash cutters is ready to fire, it will do so. This makes using Phalanx as a movement tool even more important. Because of how quick each flash cutter hits, you don’t quite need to worry about your shaking movements throwing off your aim on the target so long you don’t shake way too much.

However, in daily missions where invaders are literally everywhere, there is simply no benefit in this apex. In fact, it may well be a debuff as the flash cutters will instead not fire as quickly as you want it to compared to the normal flash cutter operation where the flash cutters are able to go off when you expect it to. This ends up being more frustrating to use. It only helps in light waves where the damage will not be leaked, but such waves are simple enough it simply does not matter if you miss a shot.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_59_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Double Phalanx
- Type: Aura
- Description: A smaller additional Phalanx is placed at the front.
- Interpretation: A Phalanx with half of the original strength and size will be place front.
- Form: Alpha
- Price: 5000
- Score: 2.36 / 5

A great defensive apex that tremendously boosts Boxer’s shoveling capability, allowing it to do more Phalanx shovelings as the smaller Phalanx allows for respectable clearance space, while still allowing the original larger Phalanx to be alive (although damaged) if the shoveling is carefully controlled.
