# All Ships

> An illustrated book for each ship.

## Introduction

The ships in the game are divided into three types: Shield Breaking, Armor Piercing, and High Impact. The main weapons of the ships are designed to target different types of invaders.

- Shield Breaker: Deals 2.5 times damage to invader shields.
- Armor Piercer: Ignores 30% damage reduction of armored invaders.
- High Impact: Has a 25% chance to deal 150% damage when attacking.

The skills of the ships are divided into three categories: Main weapon, Aura, and Zen. The introductions of Auras and Zen have been provided in the respective sections.

The main weapon of the ships also undergoes changes with upgrades. Unlike Auras and Zen, the main weapon's upgrade to the ultimate level hardly brings any qualitative changes, so the main weapon of the ships is generally upgraded last.

Here are the upgrade prices for the ships:

| Level | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | Ultimate |
| ----- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | -------- |
| Cost  | 0    | 100  | 250  | 500  | 750  | 1250     |
