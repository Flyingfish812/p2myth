## Survival

- With REMP as its only real defence, Scuuxun has very little to rely on for defence. Use REMP wisely. It is best used in daily missions about 1s before lasers fire so that you have enough time to strafe and avoid them.
- LS is a slight boost as it helps to pop turrets off so that Scuuxun has less to deal with.
- Scuuxun’s main is difficult to use due to its slow travelling main.
- Consider Scuuxun’s main damage from its LS and REMP, while the main is simply a support.
- Because of the slow rate of recovery of REMP, there is a need to space them out properly between waves. Ideally REMP is used once per wave Act 4 and above. REMP is usually used to open up a wave.
- However, because of how quick some waves go down, sometimes it is instead beneficial to deploy LS into action, then find a safe spot to go to and immediately charge REMP.

## Speedrun

- Since the main is slow travelling, Scuuxun should always retreat to the bottom once a wave is cleared as much as possible.
- Charge right up to the middle of the action when a new wave starts to stream in from the top of the screen and immediately charge REMP.
- It is preferable that in a frontline Vulture wave, the Vulture’s shield should be stripped before LS goes into action. It takes one burst before the Vulture’s shield goes down.
- It is preferable you go as near to Ravens as possible so that the main does not miss.

## Fun

- REMP and LS are both fun to use.
- Unfortunately, Scuuxun’s main is very annoying to use due to its sluggishness in travel speed.
- Pile up your main weapon projectiles according to its slow speed.
- When facing a vulture in the front with several ravens and sparrows at back, precharge your main at two side, then hit the vulture in the middle, finally use REMP at the back. It can fully utilize the damage, like "shooting the bull from behind the mountain".

## Trivia

- Scuuxun was only introduced into Phoenix 2 at v3.0.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_67_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Extended Range
- Type: Zen
- Description: Improved amplifiers increase the EMP range.
- Interpretation: The max range increases from 225 to 280.
- Form: Tau
- Price: 40000
- Score: 3.00 / 5

The increased REMP range makes a ton of difference in a bullet heavy mission, giving Scuuxun significantly more negotiation room to avoid being trapped at a corner. In particular, releasing it closer to the center of the field makes the effects of this apex extremely noticeable, clearing up a lot more space than usual, even clearing up a respectable amount of shurikens without positioning yourself too near to shuriken launchers and risk dying. The increase in navigable space also allow Scuuxun to dodge incoming laser fire very effectively.

## APEX 2

- Name: Seeker T'kari
- Type: Main Weapon
- Description: T'kari Spikes now have slight homing capabilities.
- Interpretation: nan
- Form: Delta
- Price: 20000
- Score: 1.82 / 5

This apex makes its T’Kari spikes have slight homing capabilities. The slight homing of the T’Kari spikes allow Scuuxun to offset slightly to one side and still be able to hit its invaders, useful against slightly tracking lasers.
