## Survival

- Particularly reliable against MIRV/Shuriken missions, BEMP ruthlessly eliminates bullets.
- You can launch multiple BEMPs to keep on clearing the field. Particularly, make sure you launch a BEMP just before or when the current wave ends, so that you can reliably set up MB for the next wave.
- Once the MB goes off, quickly sweep the field to eliminate Ravens and refill BEMP.
- However, if you are faced with a front heavy wave, then you must go upfield and charge MB so that MBc lands on them. Particularly, landing MBc on frontline Eagles is essential otherwise BEMP will not last you long enough to destroy the front Eagles to eliminate their entourage of shurikens. This move of landing MBc is risky but has to be pulled off, otherwise you will not survive.
- Against MIRV Bloomers, you must be brave and go up close to the frontline of MIRVs and launch BEMP pre-emptively so that you can catch the released pellets before they spread out towards the bottom of the field.
- BEMP's stun allows you to set up MB if BEMP is huge. Simply use BEMP, swipe to the bottom of the screen and begin charging MB. Beware of boomerangs and darts however, if they are sufficiently well behind it should be quite safe to charge MB. This technique works very well on Eagles and above.
- In the case of a mis-estimation and the last invader is not yet destroyed, simply tap again and release to release another burst of the main and restart the MB charging.
- The strong and concentrated main allows you to pop off turrets quite quickly on bigger invaders.
- BEMP is your only means to deal against lasers that are headed straight for you. Use BEMP wisely when threatened by lasers.
- Try not to use BEMP as a last minute resort, but instead as a repositioning tool to allow you to destroy invaders quickly.
- The 2 points above can be used in conjuction you can reposition yourself to hit another invader while avoiding tracking lasers.
- Small BEMPs can be used to mostly deal with pellets released by MIRVs, or misaligned darts that completely block off your escape path.

## Speedrun

- The main weapon is very powerful and optimizing its burst is important. Unfortunately, Veil's sustained burst with very little downtime means that it is extremely difficult to optimize without leaking part of it, especially for Ravens which cannot be killed by an MB.
- Because of the bursty and long nature of its main, it is easy to set-up MB for the next wave as you can start pre-charging MB every time you suspect the last invader is going to die, and let it proceed when the next wave is inbound. This ability to pre-charge means that you should always aim to MB every medium wave or above.
- However, if there are front Ravens with dart spreads, it is usually near impossible to utilize MBc.

## Fun

- Powerful and satisfying main weapon Fusion Laser is easy to use, and great to hear in action.
- Doing AoE damage with MB is fun for sure.

## Trivia

- Veil is one of the 3 starter ships that you can get from your first warp gate activation.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_4_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: EMP Core
- Type: Zen
- Description: Fusion Core also destroys enemy bullets.
- Interpretation: The bullets within a range of 100 will be cleared.
- Form: Beta
- Price: 10000
- Score: 1.73 / 5

Arguably, this is the most useful MBc BEMP Apex of all the ships that have this apex due to its viability in MIRV/Shuriken missions. This apex allows Veil to push forward after releasing MB in order to fire BEMP further upfield and be able to catch a few more MIRVs descending onto you, rather than spending another BEMP to completely clear the field for a MB charge on the subsequent wave.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_4_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Shield Breaker
- Type: Zen
- Description: Mega Bomb explosion is extra effective against shields.
- Interpretation: Mega Bomb deals 2.5x damage against shields (Fusion core not included).
- Form: Sigma
- Price: 35000
- Score: 4.64 / 5

This apex is insane and helps so much in speedrunning. One of the most annoying things about Veil is it's sustained burst which makes it extremely difficult to optimize, especially when you are trying to run around and kill rapidly moving Ravens. This apex completely eliminates this problem and you can focus your main on bigger invaders which are much easier to hit and thus a lot less optimization to do. SB MB not only decimates Shielded Ravens, but leaves no mercy to other shielded invaders, stripping their shield immediately, up until an Eagle. Landing MBc on 2 Eagles will devastate them, making them go down even before they can pump insane amounts of shurikens or MIRVs on field.
