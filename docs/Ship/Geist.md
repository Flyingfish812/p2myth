## Survival

- PS is its only defence. This works very well in its missions it is intended for, but in Unprotected missions, you will face a lot of problems with darts since they are fast and you can quickly get overwhelmed.
- Only PS in Unprotected missions when the wave has no lasers, or when the lasers (whether directly from the invaders themselves or from laser MIRVs) are about to fire. More priority should be given to laser from invaders. Thus always try to time the activation of laser MIRVs to the firing of lasers from invaders.
- Geist absolutely wrecks Rocs due to its high main DPS combined with damage from PS. Under the right hands, Geist has usually no issues getting past any Roc. Destroy the initial wave of invaders before the Roc arrives with an MS or 2, grab their particles for a full MS for the Roc and leave particles floating around from the previous wave. When the Roc arrives, launch the MS, and rush forward to grab the particles you left behind and immediately fire a second MS. The Roc will go down in no time, particularly if the Roc has lasers to use PS for additional laser reflect.

## Speedrun

- As mentioned above, Geist absolutely wrecks Rocs.
- A combination of the main and MS will take care of the light waves.
- Since Geist's main is a burst weapon, a very good combo is to let the main be primed (when the main is about to fire, you can see a pinkish glow in front of the ship), and then deploy PS. The main continues to fire while the PS reflects lasers. Just be careful not to deploy PS too late, don't use this technique if you know you can't make it before the lasers fire.
- Geist can feel quite close to FO at times, since it has a very high damage main, has MS, and PS deals a lot of damage in the missions it is meant for. However, it is by no means the fastest, although in good hands, it can clinch a Top 1% in Hull missions.
- Remember that Geist rewards aggression. Getting up close to the larger invaders when you can will ensure no DPS is spilled. On earlier waves, it's a better idea to stand back to cover the spread of invaders around the field. In heavier and/or dense waves, it is generally not too much of an issue to stand back, particularly when there are so many turret aiming at you.

## Fun

- Geist has the highest potential damage per main weapon burst, coming in at â‰ˆ70-75 damage, not accounting for crits.
- Given the missions it is meant for, PS is very fun to use, and to watch invaders destroy themselves really just puts a smile on your face.
- Its highly bursty main is actually really fun to use, due to its wide spread, which means that you are almost guaranteed to hit some invader no matter what.
- Unfortunately, the wide spread and bursty nature of the main also means that optimizing Geist's main to go fast can get frustrating. But if you are just using Geist to have fun, it's definitely a fun ship to play.
- The impact sounds of its main are satisfying to hear.
- Geist reactor position can be a little awkward, partially because of its dark green design.

## Trivia

- Geist was supposed to get an apex that was silver in color. Unfortunately, the devs felt it did not fit Geist, although they feel it was pretty "slick". It was never revealed how it might have looked like.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_23_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Ion Warheads
- Type: Aura
- Description: Missiles equipped with Ion charges stun turrets on impact.
- Interpretation: Missiles stun the turrets within 50 range for 0.6s.
- Form: Phi
- Price: 45000
- Score: 3.82 / 5

Compared with the same APEX of EX04239, its problem is that the main weapon is not so friendly, making it difficult to take into account all the invaderes on the field when doing the last hit.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_23_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: High Explosive
- Type: Aura
- Description: Missiles equipped with advanced warheads deal blast damage on impact.
- Interpretation: Missiles deal 1 AOE damage within 50 range.
- Form: Sigma
- Price: 35000
- Score: 2.18 / 5

Similar to most high-explosive missile APEXs, it is very effective against very dense invader formations and avoids the problem of needing multiple last hits.
