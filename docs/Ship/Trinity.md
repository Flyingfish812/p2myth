## Comments

- Dark骑士：Trinity's Teleport is useless, it will be greater if changing the darkfire into a lance.

## Survival

- Trinity's TP deals railgun damage, which actually does 15 damage instead of the 8 damage stated.
- The reason for this is just because of its double defence combo which works very well. While they do work together at times, separately, they are just one of the best Auras and Zens.
- However, Trinity still requires skill to operate properly, otherwise its survivability will not be realized.
- Both CF and TP are used rather equally, and they are able to combat different situations, which is what makes Trinity very survivable.
- CF is used when you are faced with bullets that are approaching too fast for you to charge a TP. It may be also used when you faced with bullets coming from everywhere and you are confused as to what to do.
- CF is also used when lasers are just about to fire. This is more efficient than using TP to avoid lasers. However, when low on Aura, TP can also serve as a backup option.
- TP is used when you are faced with an incoming thick wall of shurikens. Simply just TP away. Problem solved.
- If you feel sufficiently threatened, you can also use TP to go to the other side of the field per usual. Just remember to do it early in General/Boomerang missions because bullets can move very fast.
- You may also use CF if particles are simply overflowing. In this case, if you are deploying CF simply to make use of the particles, try to deploy CF as close to the centre line of the field as possible. This allows you more flexibility to move around, since you need to aim with Trinity.
- The aiming aspect of Trinity is also why some players are unable to wield Trinity properly, as they are too concerned with surviving (given that they are given so many tools of survivability) that they forget to destroy invaders. Although Trinity can survive for quite long, it can't do so forever.
- Trinity's highly focused main allows it to take out dangerous turrets fast. This is when Trinity TP works so well. TP yourself in line with the dangerous turret so that the railgun damage will make turret popping even faster.
- It is desirable to use TP to get right in front of dangerous turrets to take them out first. Simply TP right in front of the dangerous turret, then deploy a CF immediately. If you feel there are other turrets to the side of the dangerous turret which are of sufficient threat (such as a high tier pellet spread), you may instead opt to TP right inbetween the 2 turrets to deploy your CF so that you can pop off both turrets safely. CF's invincibility time is enough time to pop off 2 turrets.
- Otherwise, if you are forced to use CF due to dangerous circumstances, ensure you have a safe exit after CF expires.
- In Roc battles, you should TP to the behind Roc turrets and deploy a CF such that it covers as many turrets as possible, and then proceed to pop off the dangerous turrets. Remember that shuriken launchers are of no issue since you can simply TP away from the impending shuriken cloud. Remember to TP back down once the CF has expired.
- Usually popping one side of the dangerous behind turrets in the Roc is enough for you to survive comfortably, but you can employ the same tactic on the other side of the Roc's turrets if the turrets are really dangerous enough for you to feel stuck even on the safer side. However, you will require conserved particles from previous waves. Also, bear in mind that unless it's 5-4, you may struggle in the next wave with the lack of particles since a Roc doesn't give a lot of particles when destroyed. Try to survive with the other side of behind turrets still alive if possible, unless it's 5-4 or you are confident the next wave is easy.
- Beware of Trinity's reactor position because it is a lot more forward than usual, which means less time to respond to dodging bullets if you are intending to use a TP without a CF.
- Try your best not to reposition your finger of stylus too much because the main very quickly stops firing after you lift your touch from the screen.
- One of the highest level of invincibility tactics of Trinity lies in the fact how well the time slowdown of TP and the Phase Out of CF works together. In the last 0.1s of Phase Out, it is possible to graze bullets to gain Aura for another CF. Executed well in Armor Bullet Hell days, by pre-charging TP before CF expires, you can safely graze tons of bullets, giving you enough Aura during this 1s (in real time, since TP slows time by 90%) to deploy another CF and thus continue staying invincible. 1s is a lot of leeway time so you can afford to simply only make use of 0.5s just to be safe and still graze tons of bullets to be able to deploy another CF. This tactic requires lots of practice but once mastered, makes Trinity simply invincible.

## Speedrun

- Trinity's DPS is quite high. Unfortunately, there is quite a bit of DPS leaking when switching targets.
- CF can be used as a positional tool to aid killing invaders. Be sure to deploy as central as possible (with respect to the invader distribution)
- Trinity TP adds additional DPS. A good speed optimization technique is to use Trinity TP just before the next wave arrives fully. The railgun can then do additional first strike damage on top of the main. Just be careful not to do it if you already over abused TP.

## Fun

- Trinity TP is one of the most satisfying to pull off due to the extremely satisfying pop sound the railgun gives off when it hits its target. It is also a unique sound that is exclusive to Trinity.

## Trivia

- Trinity was only introduced into Phoenix 2 at v2.5.
- Trinity is one of the 5 ships that got brought over from Phoenix 2's predecessor game, Phoenix HD.
- Although Trinity technically has a unique Zen, under the Zen filter, if TP is selected, Trinity also appears as one of the filtered ships.
- Trinity used to be slightly more invincible due to a technique, but no one knows what it was. The editor guess it's to TP into the bullet hell then graze to use a small Chrono Field, and then you repeat this process.
- Calculatrice of invader's HP.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_64_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Deep Field
- Type: Aura
- Description: A slightly larger Chrono Field that also slows down turrets.
- Interpretation: The max radius increases by 25% (about 200), the turrets' speed are slowed down to 30%.
- Form: Phi
- Price: 45000
- Score: 2.27 / 5

This apex encourages extremely aggressive gameplay, going upfield all the time to wreck havoc among the invaders while they struggle to pump in bullet onto the field. Most importantly, it does increase the survivability of Trinity as you could TP right onto a dangerous turret and deploy CF on top of them to slow them down so that you won’t be faced with so much problems. In particular, while Trinity can survive anything, MIRVs are still a problem for it as CF does not eliminate the problem (but simply delays it), while the cooldown of TP can stack until it becomes large enough to result in your death from the inability to escape. The increase in CF size comfortably covers the extreme ends of a Vulture, accounting for their slightly random movement, useful for taking out MIRV Bloomers.

As Trinity’s main weapon is strictly forward firing, the increase in CF size allows it to reach invaders at the extreme sides of the field. It is particularly useful in Sparrow heavy waves that emit continuous dart streams. It is also useful in being able to just reach some of the other invaders, or their turrets to take them out. More than that, the slowdown of turrets is very useful, especially on larger invaders with more deadly turrets. You should then jump straight into the thick of the mess in order to take out these more deadly turrets first before dealing with the rest of the crowd. Remember to refill your Aura if there is insufficient time to take them all out by killing a few Sparrows or Ravens. Taking out these deadly turrets before they can start firing or fire more volleys make survival easier and gives you a peace of mind to take out the other invaders.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_64_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Darkfire Blast
- Type: Zen
- Description: The Darkfire shot upon Teleport arrrival now deals blast damage.
- Interpretation: The Darkfire shot deals an AOE damage of range 100.
- Form: Delta
- Price: 20000
- Score: 2.55 / 5

This apex makes the railgun that Trinity fires upon arrival from TP explode on impact with an invader, with a very small blast radius. Damage is unchanged. The blast damage is AP (meaning it does not suffer from damage reduction from Invader Armor) if the darkfire shot lands on the cockpit of armored invaders.
