## Comments

- Dark骑士: Frequently used in shielded missions in the past, and it's harder and harder to use in the present.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_57_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: High Capacity
- Type: Aura
- Description: Vorpal Lance can store more energy, adding an additional Counter.
- Interpretation: The max volume increases from 4 to 5.
- Form: Epsilon
- Price: 25000
- Score: 2.82 / 5

To be honest, the Exarch probably doesn't need such an APEX. But considering that the combination of the Mega Laser and the Vorpal Lance can quickly clear a wave of invaders, sometimes there will indeed be more energy to charge for the fifth lance. When you find that you need a fifth lance to face an attack, first think about whether there is a better solution, whether it is necessary to use 5 lances (such as lance scanning), and whether you can use fewer lances to achieve the same effect. Secondly, the improvement brought by another APEX that strengthens the main weapon - Phase Refraction - is generally more obvious than the effect of one more lance.

This apex gives each of the prisms a small angular range instead of simply being fixed at their original angle, thus having a better catch rate for invaders, and even allowing the corner prisms to fire when it normally does not do so when faced with large invaders. The angular range of each prism is about ±2° of the original fixed angle.
