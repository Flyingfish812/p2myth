## Survival

- Synergy between BEMP and Kappa allows infinite spam of BEMP, which can be used as a desperate last minute attempt to survive, especially in MIRV/Shuriken missions. Use the time slowdown of Kappa Overdrive to carefully graze bullets and refill Aura.
- Shinova will start to struggle a bit on heavier waves due to the inability to navigate the field without a replenishment of BEMP. The flood of MIRVs all around the field and a main that is difficult to aim makes it very difficult to eliminate invaders or turrets once BEMP runs low.
- Particularly, Shinova struggles against MIRV Bloomers on Vultures since Vultures are huge and take time to kill while MIRV Bloomers just flood the field with MIRVs so quickly.
- Doesn't survive well with lasers since it doesn't have a way to deal with them. You can only use BEMP to clear enough space to strafe. However, because BEMP is spammed a lot, the amount of space cleared is usually quite small. Try to reserve BEMP until just before the lasers fire.

## Speedrun

- No offensive Aura or Zen
- Main weapon can be optimized to land almost every shot, however. BEMP does help a bit in positioning your shots correctly. However, the slow moving main makes it annoying to hit invaders so there'll be a couple of leaked projectiles no matter what.

## Fun

- Very slow gameplay due to Kappa Drive. In armor bullet hell missions, it is extremely tiring. Clear times for Shinova in armor bullet hell missions are usually excruciatingly long.
- Very bad reactor position. There's almost no way you can dodge through bullets without explicitly looking at its reactor.
- Its main weapon Tachyon Cannon travels very slowly and is very unsatisfying. Coupled with the left-right alternating firing, the main is anti-fun.
- The feeling of clearing bullets is great, but you seldom get a full Aura to clear massive areas due to its slow kill rate and thus less particles to fill your Aura.

## Trivia

- Shinova is used to be one of the ships that you can get from your first warp gate. It was subsequently removed in the v4.2 or v4.3 update.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_1_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Extended Range
- Type: Aura
- Description: Amplifiers give Bullet EMP more range.
- Interpretation: The max radius increases from 450 to 500.
- Form: Alpha
- Price: 5000
- Score: 2.18 / 5

The faster increase in BEMP range can be life saving. The capability to very quickly generate a usable smallest size BEMP can save your life especially in longer battles against bigger invaders such as Vultures and above, as demonstrated in 5-3 and 5-4. It also enables you to fire larger range BEMPs to eliminate potentially more MIRVs in order to enable better navigability without the fear of exploding MIRVs while navigating to eliminate smaller invaders.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_1_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Destructive Wave
- Type: Aura
- Description: An Enhanced Bullet EMP that also deals damage to Invaders.
- Interpretation: Bullet EMP deals at most 10 damage to invaders within range.
- Form: Delta
- Price: 20000
- Score: 4.64 / 5

The inaccurate main of Shinova is one of its biggest downfalls, which this apex fixes since Destructive BEMP can take care of the cumbersome Sparrows that can easily escape the slow moving projectiles. Kappa also means that holding on to Kappa at expense of firing may be even beneficial for the cooldown phase of later waves where only Sparrows upfield remain, provided enough Sparrows are left on field.
