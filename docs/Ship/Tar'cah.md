## Survival

- Synergy between PD and Kappa allows you to spam PD infinitely.
- PD allows you to quickly eliminate the first wave of MIRVs that come your way.
- Unfortunately, after that, the shurikens start flooding in which becomes too much for PD to eliminate.
- Always stay on one side of the field in daily missions. Try not to move too much. Only start move when the shuriken cloud has passed you. T4 patterned shuriken launchers that lock onto you will have their shurikens go right pass you through the middle due to the clear lanes defined by the pattern. Moving a bit will cause you to come in contact with the pattern by the T4 shuriken launchers which will burn a lot more PD.
- Use PD to eliminate the rest of the shurikens and pellets (from launchers and from MIRVs that explode) that come into the lane towards you. Only use PD when these shurikens are at point blank range, otherwise you will waste unnecessary Aura.
- When in the shuriken cloud made by T4 shuriken launchers, don't bother to burn PD to eliminate MIRVs before they explode. Let them explode. Only use PD to eliminate MIRVs after the shuriken cloud has almost completely dispersed from the field.
- Prioritize the elimination of MIRV Bloomers if they exist, otherwise, kill the other Ravens with rapid firing MIRV launchers.
- Once one side is cleared, you can start to slowly shift laterally to another side to destroy the rest of the invaders. This process is usually extremely painful. I would suggest you only do this after the shuriken cloud has mostly dispersed so that you can use PD to eliminate MIRVs without the obstruction of shurikens. In the meantime, while trapped in the shuriken cloud, you can spam Kappa to generate enough Aura so that you can eliminate MIRVs without them popping later.
- If there is not enough Aura to eliminate MIRVs even after the shuriken cloud has dispersed, don't be afraid to simply stay on the emptier side and simply let Kappa run to generate Aura for you. It is faster than diving right in and exploding MIRVs since you don't need to dodge the pellets released.
- Against General/Boomerang missions, use Kappa to carefully graze dart streams, as well as dodge boomerangs and between pellets released by MIRVs.

## Speedrun

- No offensive Aura or Zen.
- The bursty nature of Tar'Cah's main allows it to continuously deal damage to invaders even while spamming Kappa. However, due to the thin nature of the main, it is very difficult to hit invaders even with the full burst being fired most of the time, since you are forever trapped in a sea of bullets around you, and you have to inch slowly towards the other side once one side of the field is cleared. The switching of targets take a very long time because of this.
- The weapon mismatch makes things all the worse, and it is difficult to aim to the cockpit of invaders when you are so focused with survival.

## Fun

- It is quite a rhythm to release touch, and then use one contact to fire (and sometimes inch a bit to either side), and then after the first contact is established, use a second touch to fire PD.
- However, gameplays are extremely lengthy.

## Trivia

- Tar’Cah is one of the 7 ships that doesn’t use thrusters to fly in Phoenix 2. It looks like Tar’Cah actually glides through the air using its thin flaps attached to the ring. Now we can only wonder how the Lambda Apex continues to glide with all those torn flaps...

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_3_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: EMP Laser
- Type: Aura
- Description: Destroyed bullets trigger a small Bullet EMP.
- Interpretation: Laser Beams decreased from 10 to 1, but a Bullet EMP of range 50 will be activated each time.
- Form: Delta
- Price: 20000
- Score: 3.45 / 5

This APEX strengthens the defensive ability of Point Defense, and combined with the Kappa Drive to absorb energy, it can ensure a strong survivability in the bullet hell.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_3_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Bullet Detonator
- Type: Aura
- Description: Enemy bullets are detonated dealing Blast damage.
- Interpretation: Each detonated bullet deals 2 AOE damage.
- Form: Lambda
- Price: 30000
- Score: 4.18 / 5

A very powerful tool to deal against crowds of invaders, Bullet Detonator turns Tar’Cah into an offensive ship where quickly draining PD when the wave first arrives can deal devastating damage to quickly clear out the frontline invaders. Kappa can also be spammed at intervals where the Aura is running slightly low to quickly refill the Aura after killing some invaders in front. Just be careful not to overuse it and overfill on particles. It can even be used against bullet spinners where going near can deal massive damage to the invader carrying that turret. In some cases, with a sufficient Aura and some luck, the spinner turret will be destroyed halfway.
