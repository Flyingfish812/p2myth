## Survival

- With absolutely no forms of defensive abilities, once you are stuck, it's the end for you.
- It doesn't help that it has poor DPS, although this does mean that with perfect homing accuracy, you can expect to flail about the field a lot. In particular, going upfield will occur a lot.
- Despite going upfield, the mission type it can only have a shot at features tracking dart turrets that will still fire directly upon it, making it still very difficult to use.
- The FL fired at the start of the wave can be used to pop off turrets on Herons and Eagles.

## Speedrun

- Despite an FO ship, the weak DPS, combined with an under-powered LS and FL make this ship still relatively slow. It simply does not compare to its other FO peers.
- Because of the fact Reaper goes upfield frequently, and it is even more difficult to ultilize FL after the initial FL is fired at the start of the wave.

## Fun

- Aside from the fact that FL is forward firing, the entire ship is automatic aiming. This makes it quite stress free. Simply fire FL at the start of a wave, then feel free to move around anywhere you want.
- Arguably Reaper's visuals are one of the best, with animated dragonfly-like wings and an awesome main, with actual swarms of what it looks like fireflies flying about.

## Trivia

- Reaper was only introduced into Phoenix 2 at v5.0.
- Reaper is the ship with the most animated visuals, where viewing the static ship at face value (in the ship selection screen) is nothing like viewing it in the ship view screen (after you tap on the ship card in the ship selection screen)
- Reaper is one of the 7 ships which doesn’t use thrusters to fly in Phoenix 2. Instead, it uses its animated wings like a real dragonfly.
- After you die, the resting projectiles may succeed in killing the rest invaders, make you die without regrets.
- It’s funny that this ship isn’t named Dragonfly instead, given its actual similarities to its real life counterpart.

*So who is the real Dragonfly?*

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_81_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Shield Breaker
- Type: Aura
- Description: Laser Moon type S deals extra damage to shields.
- Interpretation: Lasers deal 2.5x damage to shields.
- Form: Tau
- Price: 40000
- Score: 3.09 / 5

This apex opens up new viability to Reaper, allowing its use in Shielded Laser/Pellet missions, since Unprotected Laser/Pellet or Pellet/Shuriken/Laser missions don't currently exist. Being the easiest mission type with no turrets that actively lock onto Reaper, it is very safe for Reaper to head upfield and launch devastating LS attacks which rips invaders rather quickly due to the massive increased damage from its SB LS. Despite its increase in DPS, its raw firepower is still quite lacking which make it subpar even as an FO. It will breeze through every wave, but it is likely to get hard stuck at 5-4 in Marshal rank missions. It simply does not kill fast enough to avoid a pile-up of bullets, making it difficult to bring it to other mission types. It is however, a pretty fun apex to bring out on Shielded Laser/Pellet missions where you can flail all about the field to avoid lasers.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_81_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Lance Wake
- Type: Zen
- Description: Destroys enemy bullets hit by Focus Lance.
- Interpretation: Lance will clear the bullets like Vorpal Lance.
- Form: Lambda
- Price: 30000
- Score: 2.55 / 5

This apex helps in giving it some viability in slightly bullet heavier missions, such as General/Boomerang missions. Being able to ride up the FL like riding a VL helps to get it out of some tight situations. However, because Laser/Dart missions don't feature many bullets, it doesn't help much in its mission type, but can see some use in lower rank General/Boomerang or community missions.
