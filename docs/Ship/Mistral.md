*Despite being FO, Mistral struggles to keep up with other classic FO ships, because its main weapon is unable to deal burst damage, moreover, both means of dealing AoE damage just aren’t lethal enough to wipe out invaders straight away, unless... ...hmmm... ... (pondering.jpg)*

## Survival

- Mistral’s Aura and Zen are both offensive. In other words, it has no defensive capabilities at all.
- The only improvement for survivability comes from its Disintegrator Warhead Apex, as it enables GM to clear bullets in its AoE.
- If you are using the Disintegrator Warhead Apex, it is recommended that you use two GMs at a time, one on each side of the field.

## Speedrun

- Mistral has an average main weapon. It’s usually used for cleaning up the field after MB and GM usage.
- When Caged MIRVs appear, you should try to graze them for energy, then release GM (with Disintegrator Warhead Apex) to clear bullets, and then graze again, rinse and repeat. Also, be sure to graze Caged MIRVs at the beginning of each Act. Using this technique grants you sufficient energy, besides, it keeps the field relatively free of hindrance from bullets. 
- To deal with dense waves, you may opt to throw two GMs to the back row invaders plus two to the front, or you can throw GMs in a triangular layout, i.e., one on the left plus two on the right, or two on the left plus one on the right.
- Mistral with Fast Charge Apex excels in Unprotected laser missions without Vultures, Condors or Rocs. Generally, MB should be used on two of the four waves of each Act, and GMs take care of the rest.
- Usually, you should try to place MBc between two Eagles side by side, and finish off with a GM.

## Fun

- In missions with Caged MIRVs, if you manage to pull off consecutive grazes, you will have almost unlimited energy, hence near unlimited GMs.
- In laser missions without bullets, Mistral with Fast Charge Apex is very fast-paced because you can spam MBs to blast invaders unrelentingly.
- Mistral can be quite boring if the main control takes away too much of your attention.

## Trivia

- Editor: Most of the time we overestimate its power, but we always underestimate its potential.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_94_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Disintegrator Warhead
- Type: Aura
- Description: Destroys enemy bullets caught in the blast.
- Interpretation: Clears all the bullets within the blast radius of about 150.
- Form: Tau
- Price: 40000
- Score: 3.82 / 5

This Apex benefits Mistral hugely in missions with Caged MIRVs, because consecutive grazes allow you to fire GMs almost limitlessly to deal damage and clear bullets, which means that you don’t have to worry about frequent dodging. Obviously, this requires you to have very solid basic skills, not only in movement and dodging, but also the accurate positioning of GMs

Who would have thought that it could go [this fast](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Gy421a7PD/) (yeah right)

## APEX 2

- Name: Fast Charge
- Type: Zen
- Description: High efficiency charge algorithms charge Mega Bomb more quickly.
- Interpretation: The charging time decreases from 2s to 1.75s, the charging time recovery decreases from 4.5s to 3.5s.
- Form: Lambda
- Price: 30000
- Score: 3.80 / 5

This Apex benefits Mistral hugely in Unprotected laser missions, because MB spamming wipes out invaders so fast. You hardly have chance of lacking GM if no larger invaders are present. Therefore, Mistral can be used to its full potential as an FO ship.
