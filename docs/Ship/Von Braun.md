## Survival

- No defense. Kappa allows you to dodge through tight gaps, but there's absolutely no way to clear them, and you just have to resort to clearing fast.
- Fortunately MS is a very good solution to clearing fast. Its high burst damage clears invaders out really fast.
- Sadly, the massive amount of invaders in the dense waves of daily missions make it difficult to clear them all quickly. Be careful with your Kappa usage as using Kappa will suck in all the particles and quickly overfill.
- Von Braun's main takes care of the bigger invaders, while the constant MS spam deals with the smaller ones, and also helps out in the destruction of bigger invaders.

## Speedrun

- In community and specialist missions, spamming Kappa is desirable since all the Aura build up over Kappa can be immediately dispensed of. A slight bit of wastage from firing too many missiles is generally fine since Kappa generates its own particles.
- Furthermore, a properly optimized main means very little DPS is actually being leaked from the missiles that have no targets left to hit. To optimize the main in community and specialist missions, try to be on top of the invader, but to the extreme left or right side of it so that you aren't that of a point blank range.
- In daily missions, it's better to stand back since so many turrets are firing at you, and since invaders are almost everywhere, the Daisy Cutters are pretty much guaranteed to hit something.
- Even in light waves, the turrets in such waves are extremely aggressive and will continuously pump bullets on the field which makes it impractical to be on top of them. In such light waves, just pray the Daisy Cutters may help out in eliminating a Raven or Sparrow. MS will do most of the job here.
- Sadly, Kappa usage in daily missions is very difficult. Kappa is used to carefully regulate the pace of the main. But if you allow Kappa to keep going, it will quickly eat up all the particles on field and result in massive overfill. Conversely, if you allow the main to simply fire at its constant intervals, it will result in the main missing when the next waves comes in.
- To try your best to alleviate this problem, only spam Kappa if you are expecting to meet a heavy and/or dense wave after the current wave. Otherwise, let the main be wasted since MS will cover most of the job for you in light waves.

## Fun

- Von Braun is THE missile ship. Its really fun to watch all kinds of missiles fly around the screen, including the big ones from its main, and the constant spam of small missiles from its MS + Kappa combo.
- The blast damage is quite negligible to observe though, particularly when maxed, as one Daisy Cutter's blast damage no longer kills a Sparrow.

## Trivia

- Von Braun is the only ship that shares the highest DPS of 37.5, and yet has blast damage. The 37.5 DPS does not account for the blast damage.
- Von Braun's main, Daisy Cutter, is the name of a missile used in real life to clear foliage and vegetation.
- Von Braun's name may be a reference to the German aerospace engineer and space architect. More specifically, Wernher Magnus Maximilian Freiherr von Braun was the leading figure in the development of rocket technology in Germany and a pioneer of rocket and space technology in the United States.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_36_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Armor Piercing
- Type: Aura
- Description: Reinforced warheads allow these missiles to pierce enemy armor.
- Interpretation: The missiles ignore 30% damage reduction of armors.
- Form: Delta
- Price: 20000
- Score: 4.82 / 5

The extra power in MS can make all the difference in early waves in whether they are able to destroy an entire wave. Under normal circumstances, MS may leave out a few Sparrows standing due to various reasons such as insufficient Aura or failures to lock on properly. With this apex, it is even possible to eliminate Sparrows that MS failed to lock on to as the remainder rogue missiles that have no target left to lock on to. Being able to eliminate the rest of the smaller invaders means less chasing them down with the difficult to handle Daisy Cutter. The increased damage also helps in later waves to quickly eliminate dangerous invaders faster before they start flooding the field with bullets or firing lasers.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_36_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Improved Thrusters
- Type: Main Weapon
- Description: Daisy Cutters have better homing capabilities.
- Interpretation: nan
- Form: Beta
- Price: 10000
- Score: 2.27 / 5

This apex improves the homing capabilities of its Daisy Cutters. The severely upgraded homing capabilities allow the Daisy Cutters to very reliably take down Ravens, and hit Sparrows with high accuracy, making Von Braun much less frustrating to play.
