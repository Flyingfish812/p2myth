## Survival

- Torrent's main weapon is really strong for its fast tracking, with a 31.25 DPS. This means Torrent kills quite fast.
- The only gripe about Torrent is that the main always deploys from the centerline, so sometimes a bit of DPS can leak if there are no invaders in front of you.
- Torrent generally relies on deploying its SEMP immediately when the wave fully arrives, and quickly taking out as much invaders as it can. This is because the darts deployed can quickly overwhelm Torrent. This involves using the stun duration to quickly run around to the smaller invaders, kill them, grab their particles, and unleash another SEMP where possible.
- Due to the weapon flaw mentioned above, this can be difficult to achieve, but the freedom of running around should allow you to get right in front of the invaders. Just be careful not to crash into any turrets.
- In daily missions however, since invaders are everywhere, it is usually sufficient to stay at the bottom of the screen and sweep from one side to the other. Remember to go above Eagles and Vultures if they are in front, although such cases are pretty rare. For Eagles, in fact, there are times it doesn't matter because after the first SEMP goes off, you can get near to them to collect enough particles for a second SEMP which will give you enough time to destroy at least one of them.
- Because of Torrent's fast tracking nature, and thus its auto aim nature, it can be very difficult to get Torrent to aim at the turret you wish to pop off.
- However, in community and specialist missions, you can try popping off the corner turrets (particularly that of a Vulture, sometimes even Eagles) by starting from the far corner, away from other turrets, and that corner turret being the nearest to you. It may not always work 100% of the time, but it's at least more reliable. Furthermore, SEMP allows you to have this freedom of movement to try and convince the main weapon to hit where you want.
- For the center turrets on Eagles, it is a gamble since the main may choose to hit the cockpit instead. Don't count on the main weapon to pop off center turrets.

## Speedrun

- Torrent's powerful main weapon DPS, when well optimized to always hit something even when initially fired, means it can go quite fast.
- It is best to start from a side of the field, where on your other side, there are no invaders. You should then follow the Quantum Streamas it bends towards the side with invaders. Ensure the beam is either firing forward or tilted towards the side with invaders.
- Watch out for crits. Crits will kill invaders faster, which is of particular mention when it comes to Ravens and Sparrows. You will need to follow the Quantum Stream more quickly.
- Because of its powerful main, it may not always be beneficial to deploy PS to reflect lasers. It may be more beneficial to instead reserve SEMP for these moments when the lasers are about to fire so that you actually go faster.
- SEMP eliminates the need for the main to hunt down all the Sparrows, so that improves Torrent's speed quite a bit. However, in Act 1, optimization of the main becomes key to wipe out all Sparrows in one burst. This can be hard.

## Fun

- Torrent's main is pretty annoying. The ironic thing is, while the tracking improves with each main upgrade, it also makes it more annoying as it sometimes does not want to target what you to hit.
- For its PS and its recommended mission type it is used in, there are for sure quite a lot of lasers to reflect.

## Trivia

- Torrent was only introduced into Phoenix 2 at v2.1.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_55_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Super Reflect
- Type: Zen
- Description: Split-second shield activation just before laser firing will reflect back with extra force.
- Interpretation: The lasers hitting the shield at the first 0.5s will be reflected back with 5x damage.
- Form: Beta
- Price: 10000
- Score: 4.18 / 5

A very formidable apex in Laser/Dart missions, being able to take full advantage of the insane amount of lasers on field to deal insane damage. SEMP is able to cover up for the times when PS is recovering. However, with so many invaders on field in the many dense waves, most of the time SEMP is still being used to clear up majority of waves including the light waves. Super Reflect only comes into use with the presence of heavy waves. Particularly, the final wave 5-4 in Marshal ranks are likely to get obliterated with a sufficient loadout of lasers.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_55_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Extended Range
- Type: Aura
- Description: Increased power extends the range of the EMP.
- Interpretation: The max radius increases from 450 to 500.
- Form: Alpha
- Price: 5000
- Score: 2.27 / 5

This apex helps Torrent reach upfield invaders in the case where Torrent should stay at the bottom to use PS to reflect lasers, since it would be difficult to navigate the bullet mess after exiting PS. It can also help in pulling off multiple small SEMPs in order to deal more AoE damage, although that is more for speedrunning purposes.
