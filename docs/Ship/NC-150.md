## Survival

- The powerful nature of SEMP allows you to continually stun invaders in daily mission since SEMP is generally replenished quickly.
- Not only does NC-150 have a powerful means of AoE damage from SEMP, its main is very powerful and can obliterate invaders very quickly. Herons and below are completely trivial.
- Against Eagles and above, you will start to struggle a bit. However, the stun duration of a full size SEMP is enough to take out one Eagle completely.
- On heavier waves, SEMP should be fired only when a spinner/laser is about to start firing.
- If you need to save for particles in the next wave which may be a heavy wave, use PS against a wave infested with a sufficient load of lasers. Stay at the bottom if there are more tracking lasers, move further upfield if there are more spread lasers.
- After laser reflection, use PS Phase Out and get as far upfield as possible and launch an SEMP immediately.
- PS is generally used against lasers, but can be also used as a last minute defence in bullet-only waves. Use once per heavy or dense wave. In the heaviest and densest of waves, twice per wave may even be possible.
- However, in exchange for its high DPS, NC-150 has very poor turret popping capabilities. This is generally non-issue since NC-150 kills so fast. However, in heavier waves, this might necessitate the need to pop in a PS for bullet defensive measure.

## Speedrun

- A highly damaging main weapon which has a very wide spread involves going right up to the invader while it is stunned to get maximum damage
- Optimizing the main weapon to ensure as little spill as possible is key. Be as near as you possibly can. Thankfully, the spread of NC-150 is not terribly huge, so you don't exactly need to be at point blank for larger invaders which are more deadly because of their turrets and their higher health which might make them suddenly fire at you when you mis-estimate the stun duration. For a Heron, you can still stand about half of NC-150's height away from it and still inflict full damage.
- You need to be able to make quick decisions whether to use PS to reflect lasers or stun them and go right up to them, as the number of lasers in the wave may not be sufficient to justify the use of PS.
- Be prepared to go behind Eagles and Vultures after firing SEMP the first time in a wave to destroy Ravens to continuously refill your Aura and keep large invaders stunned.

## Fun

- The high DPS of NC-150 and the need to run about the field to get in close combat with invaders is very fun. SEMP makes this easy.
- Nothing is more satisfying than watching a bunch of invaders floating about helplessly from continuous SEMPs.
- Main Weapon feels great to use. It sounds like splashing water on invaders.

## Trivia

- Few players know that this ship can BoB.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_2_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: High Damage
- Type: Aura
- Description: Increased distortion of the Stun EMP causes even more damage to Invaders.
- Interpretation: The max damage increases from 10 to 15.
- Form: Gamma
- Price: 15000
- Score: 4.64 / 5

A very powerful apex, the increased damage from SEMP easily gets rid of Sparrows with a significantly smaller SEMP size, which can get annoying to chase down when the main is better reserved for larger invaders. The overall number of times you can pull off SEMPs also means greater AoE damage, severely boosting its speed on top of its highly damaging main.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_2_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Super Reflect
- Type: Zen
- Description: Split-second shield activation just before laser firing will reflect back with extra force.
- Interpretation: The lasers hitting the shield at the first 0.5s will be reflected back with 5x damage.
- Form: Beta
- Price: 10000
- Score: 4.18 / 5

A very powerful apex against waves with many lasers situated upfield, this apex can deal against heavy waves very effectively, making up for the shortfall in SEMP in being not as capable to deal with such waves. SEMP can then be reserved for later waves instead. In particular, Super Reflect obliterates Rocs and Condors alike.
