## Survival

- No defense. Kappa allows you to carefully dodge between dart streams, but there's absolutely no way to clear them, and you just have to resort to clearing fast. And LS isn't the fastest way to do that either.
- It's main can pop turrets pretty effectively. Sadly, in daily missions, there is very little turret popping to do and it's just whether you can eliminate enough invaders to reduce the laser and bullet load on field.
- In its mission type it is designed for, the slowed time Kappa provides help since the bullets are very fast. Particularly, it can help against Rocs that have many dart turrets. But when there are lasers...say goodbye to your clear.
- Unfortunately, it has no means to defend against lasers. You usually have to strafe all the way to the extreme side of the field, at least halfway up the field.

## Speedrun

- The LS does help in clearing invaders out a little faster, but LS is generally lackluster in its slow damage.
- While Kappa does help to refill LS very fast, this leads to an extreme overflow of particles in daily missions, which leads to massive wasted DPS.
- Unfortunately, the LS + Kappa combo works very badly together. The long duration of LS means you have no idea how much Kappa to use, and overusing it means a wastage of particles which severely affects your speed.

## Fun

- LS is pretty fun to watch in action for sure.
- Since the bullets in Unprotected missions are fast, it's likely that you have to abuse Kappa quite a lot otherwise your brain simply can't process everything. This means draggy gameplays.
- It's main, once maxed, is pretty consistent and not too hard to grasp, since it's simply a double burst. (The story is very different at lower levels, where the bursts are extremely weird, having a couple of short bursts followed by a long one)

## Trivia

- Elyon is one of the 7 ships that doesn’t fly using thrusters in Phoenix 2. In fact, it’s not even clear how it flies other than the light that keeps running down Elyon’s body, which doesn’t really hint anything?

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_26_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Shield Breaker
- Type: Aura
- Description: Laser Moon type S deals extra damage to shields.
- Interpretation: Lasers deal 2.5x damage to shields.
- Form: Lambda
- Price: 30000
- Score: 3.09 / 5

The Laser Storm that can break the shield means that in the shield missions, you should give priority to using the laser storm to take advantage of its 2.5x damage bonus, and then use the main weapon to take advantage of its high impact. However, most of the time, these two rules are difficult to follow, because you will not stop main weapon when Laser Storm is activated.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_26_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: High Power
- Type: Aura
- Description: A constellation of Laser Moons outputs all damage in less time.
- Interpretation: The laser moons increases from 5 to 8, the max duration decreases from 4.5s to 2.25s.
- Form: Beta
- Price: 10000
- Score: 3.36 / 5

The ability to get rid of LS faster alleviates the major problem brought about by a poor Aura Zen combination. Dense waves can quickly cause particle overflow from killing invaders very quickly due to its pseudo-FO nature. This apex allows Elyon to go significantly faster by doubling the amount of LS it can pull off.

At the end of the first period of the main weapon, activating the full aura can achieve the optimal output state because the combined time of the second and third periods of the main weapon exactly matches the high energy of the Laser Storm. If the energy supply is sufficient, it can even form a loop, making it quite enjoyable to dodge bullets with Kappa Drive. If it's a small aura, wait until the third period of the main weapon to use it, focusing damage to kill one invader at a time — provided there are invaders within the aura.
