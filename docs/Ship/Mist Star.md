## Comments

- LWM: Although the ship itself is not strong, but the feeling of impact is really great.
- Dark骑士: The main weapon has the best experience among the tracking ones that I have played so far. It has a large attack range, high hit rate and high rate of fire. It is equivalent to an enhanced version of the Yigothu's main weapon. Unfortunately, the zen has caused the appearance rate of the Mist Star to be low.

## Survival

- As the main fires in bursts, while the first of the flux seekers fire, engage Kappa to charge up a large SEMP. Disengage Kappa once the last of the flux seekers fire off. Obviously, don't do it when your Aura is already full.
- The infinite SEMP gives you flexibility to move around.
- If there are invaders hiding behind larger invaders like Vultures or Eagles, use SEMP, then go behind and quickly take out the pesky Ravens and Sparrows. This allows you to refill your Aura quickly.
- Because the main weapon is homing, and you have little control of where it wants to go, you have to force it to go where you want. SEMP which makes all invaders on field stunned (at the start of the wave) allows you to go near to Ravens to destroy them. This forces the flux seekers to hit them and thus destroy them quickly. The particles collected from going in the face of several Ravens is sufficient to blast off a 2nd SEMP before the 1st one expires (given enough Ravens on field).
- Unfortunately, this is not easy in daily missions due to just how many Ravens are around, which makes the chance of turret collision very high. Thus, you shouldn't exactly be point blank with Ravens but near enough such that one side of flux seekers can hit them with a high chance.
- It's not always possible to kill a Vulture before it fires its spinners, even after the initial SEMP. In this case, you should wait just before the spinners (it's also fine to let it fire a bit usually) before firing the second SEMP. Just remember to kill off all the smaller invaders before that happens to gain back sufficient Aura to cover both spinners.
- Because of how Kappa can get you emergency Aura, and given how fast SEMP increases in radius with little particle input, it may serve you well to on occasions, sacrifice DPS and purely activate Kappa to generate just enough Aura and position yourself so that it just nice covers all dangerous turrets. This move is very useful when you are out of particles and are faced with deadly MIRV Bloomers that are just about to fire.
- The low DPS of Mist Star will make it struggle against Eagles and above. In such situations, make sure all the smaller invaders are eliminated before retreating to the bottom of the screen.
- If the Eagles are carrying dangerous turrets such as MIRV Launchers, damage an Eagle bit by bit as you work to wipe out just enough Ravens and Sparrows to sustain SEMP. You won't usually be able to eliminate more than one Eagle but one side of Eagles should be sufficient to better ensure your survival.

## Speedrun

- The infinite SEMP spam means that quite a lot of wide but small AoE damage can be done, making it slightly speedy for crowded missions that feature lots of Ravens and Sparrows.
- Optimizing when to use SEMP is of absolute key in earlier waves. A slightly delayed SEMP to charge more Aura from Kappa makes all the difference in killing Sparrows or not. Be sure to abuse Kappa as much as you can in early waves as the SEMP damage will wipe Sparrows clean.

## Fun

- The main can be quite fun to watch, as it curves in interesting ways to reach its targets.
- The rhythm of Mist Star is quite hard to catch, so using Kappa between bursts is pretty difficult.

## Trivia

- The flux seekers are actually tiny versions of Mist Star, except without the middle wing.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_12_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Strong Stun
- Type: Aura
- Description: EMP is optimized for critical systems of Invaders to increase the stun duration.
- Interpretation: The max stun time increases from 3s to 4s.
- Form: Lambda
- Price: 30000
- Score: 1.73 / 5

This apex increases the maximum stun duration from 3s to 4s. While SEMP is very powerful in daily missions, Mist Star’s DPS struggles to keep up with destroying invaders fast enough to replenish its Aura quickly enough. This apex makes all the difference in being just able to wipe off another invader or 2 so that its Aura can be replenished on time.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_12_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Extended Range
- Type: Aura
- Description: Increased power extends the range of the EMP.
- Interpretation: The max radius increases from 450 to 500.
- Form: Gamma
- Price: 15000
- Score: 2.27 / 5

This apex encourages you to use SEMP in smaller bursts even more often. SEMP partially reverts to its level 1 status where you use SEMP purely as a reset tool. The shorter time needed to achieve the same radius for less main weapon downtime to use Kappa can make all the difference in being able to quickly reset dangerous turrets such as high tier spinners and MIRV Bloomers, and can be a huge life saver. However, be very careful as the SEMP duration does not change, which means for the same radius of SEMP, the turret(s) that were stunned stay stunned for a shorter time. Thus, it is a bad idea to stand near tracking dart turrets after launching an SEMP.
