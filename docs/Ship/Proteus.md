## Survival

- Proteus' main weapon is quite unique, it is what i call "Delayed Positional Deployment" where the weapon is first set down at a position, allowed to "charge up" for a while, before it fires straight ahead to hit a target.
- In heavier waves, the number of invaders on field increase. You can simply stay at the bottom of the screen and simply spread your photons all around where possible (otherwise one part of the field is fine), and still have almost all of the photons hit something.
- PD can be used to cut across shuriken clouds and pellet lanes. They are also very useful against boomerangs.
- ML should be used at the start of a medium wave or above. This puts less strain on PD afterwards where the number of bullets pumped onto the field becomes much less.
- PD can be used at the end of a wave to set up for ML reliably.
- Unfortunately, Proteus has no laser defence, and this is when PD conservation is key to quickly cut across bullets and dodge lasers.

## Speedrun

- The troublesome aiming system can be somewhat bypassed. If a photon is deployed on top of an invader, it immediately explodes without delay.
- The above point is what we are going to take advantage of. This is where PD now becomes an offensive tool in early waves. You should go right up to the invaders while holding down PD at all times (or at least when you know the invaders are going to fire). This allows you to safely deploy photons right on top of invaders without much risk of being killed.
- However, be careful not to go completely point blank with a dart or shuriken turret as PD is unable to respond fast enough. Aim for turrets that are not darts or shurikens. If all the turrets on the invader is too dangerous, step a little behind the midpoint of the invader. This might no longer cause the photons to immediately explode, but still have a very high chance of hitting it.
- Each photon of Proteus' main has a rather large AoE which can make times pretty fast.
- At the end of a wave, if there are enough particles, you may employ the aggressive PD technique detailed above, but be careful not to waste your particles if you need it later.
- ML setup can sometimes be made easy due to its main weapon firing system, allowing you to charge ML before the photons finish off the remainder of the wave. However, Sparrows should not be the last of the surviving invaders since they are so hard to hit. Instead, Ravens stand a good chance so be sure to leave them for last where possible.
- Proteus is very powerful against large invaders. The blast damage adds upon the impact damage of the photons, and blast damage from smaller invaders can also affect the large invader.
- With an excellent optimization of the main, especially using the aggressive PD usage detailed above, Proteus has potential to go pretty fast in community and specialist missions.

## Fun

- Proteus is the one of the only ships that features a playstyle where PD can be used offensively.
- Unfortunately, using Proteus against Sparrows is a nightmare when you don't have enough particles to use PD aggressively.
- The positioning of the photons when released is kind of hard to grasp, making catching Sparrows just as they spawn is difficult.

## Trivia

- Proteus was only introduced into Phoenix 2 at v2.1.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_53_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Sentinel
- Type: Aura
- Description: Point Defense has a passive laser that is always active and does not use energy.
- Interpretation: The nearest bullet within range will be cleared every 0.5s.
- Form: Beta
- Price: 10000
- Score: 1.00 / 5

A somewhat useful apex, this apex can be used to some effect in MIRV/Shuriken missions where bullets are slow and a sizeable PD Aura can allow you to set up MLs more easily, even allowing you to abuse it twice per wave in heaver and/or denser waves. This apex gives you error tolerance in ML set-up in case since the paths of pellets from MIRVs or even shurikens can be difficult to accurately predict.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_53_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Unstable Photons
- Type: Main Weapon
- Description: Photon Detonators trigger a larger explosion.
- Interpretation: nan
- Form: Gamma
- Price: 15000
- Score: 3.64 / 5

This apex increases the blast radius of its photon detonators from 110 to 130, an 18% increase.

A very fun apex, this apex is a huge joy to use especially in dense, Sparrow infested waves. The compounded blast damage is particularly satisfying to hear when the increased blast radius reaches so many Sparrows from just one Photon Detonator, so imagine how much more satisfying it is with tons of them hitting these invaders. The huge explosion also eliminates invaders faster and allow PD to have a chance to keep up with the bullets on field.
