## Survival

- Easiest MB ship to use. Ever. You hardly need to worry about wrong positioning due to CF. Just drop in a CF, and charge MB such that MBc hits the biggest invader on screen. That's all. It's so easy to use.
- Practically you will be abusing MB every medium wave and above, due to the fact MB cooldown plays less of a factor when you are completely safe in the CF. You can say that Ravens and Sparrows practically don't exist in such waves.
- However, since it is so viable to use MB almost every wave, you might have to forgo a few MBs. Some medium waves can be forgone since you can make use of the plenty of particles on field to chase down those Ravens and Sparrows.
- Use smaller CF to exit safely from the bullet mass if you are unable to get out of the mess of darts built up from the previous full size CF. But remember to quickly plan your escape route to a safer spot.
- Do be careful to at least somewhat aim your main weapon properly, and don't be afraid to leave your CF to hit some invaders so long there aren't too many bullets outside the CF. Do remember you have 0.5s of invincibility outside the CF so you can exit the CF just to have some of its Serrator Laser kill that lone Sparrow even though the bullet spam can get quite bad.
- Since Baqlor has no means of bullet clear, the field can get pretty messy with bullets when MB charge times get very long. While less viable in MIRV/Shuriken missions, you can still use CF to continuously Chrono Hop to a safer spot. Try to charge at a spot which has less Ravens so that you won't be faced with so many MIRVs exploding.
- In General/Boomerang missions, charging MB upfield is generally safer since the bottom of the screen will get flooded with so many other types of bullets.
- Turret popping may appear slightly difficult because of its somewhat spread laser. However, this is completely untrue as the MB that wipes out Ravens which enables you to pull of 2 consecutive CFs without issue. This means you can go point blank with the Vulture's turrets and wipe them out like nothing. You can use the Phase Out time to reposition yourself in front of the other 2 Vulture's turrets and then deploy a second CF. Only do this if there are still a lot of particles lying around otherwise a safe MB setup for the next wave will be difficult.
- Because of the fact that bullets in Unprotected Laser/Dart missions are fired in straight lines (hardly broken up or misaligned), it is very easy to do Chrono Hopping as there are clear pockets of space to hide in, thus making Baqlor so survivable. Furthermore, bullets in such missions are fast moving and clear off the field very fast, where even bullets in a CF they move with reasonable speed.
- Baqlor's turret popping ability is surprisingly excellent when dealing with Rocs. Simply just stay on one side of the field, and poof, unknowingly, the Roc's turrets disappear after a while, even those at the back row. Be sure to graze off some bullets to pull off small CFs where needed, otherwise conserve CF for the next wave (if applicable).
- Baqlor's only negative comes in its main, where the interruptible burst nature of Serrator Lasers make it slightly awkward, as not allowing the burst to complete will result in subpar damage (from the corner lasers which makes it even more awkward) after exiting an MB charge. This should be overcome by allowing the burst to complete, or fake charging MB to pace the weapon properly. This flaw, however, does not stop Baqlor from becoming one of the most survivable and speedy ships out there.

## Speedrun

- The MB spam makes Baqlor go very fast. In fact you will just be charging an MB every medium wave or above.
- The capability of Baqlor to always land MBc on larger invaders boosts its speed even further, sometimes to ridiculous speeds.
- In fact, you can even quite safely pull off 2 consecutive MBs, if there is a wave with 4 Eagles in front (land the first MBc on all 4 of them) and one Vulture behind (land the second MBc on the Vulture)
- Optimizing the main weapon is of essence to cut off several seconds. Ensure one burst of Baqlor fully completes before charging the next MB.
- Also, where MB will not be used the next wave, fake charge an MB if required so that the burst does not go off when there are no invaders around. You don't want the cornermost lasers to suddenly go off when the next wave fully arrives.
- Remember that there is a 1s cooldown between Baqlor's main bursts. You can thus still continue to engage touch for about 0.5s after the cornermost laser fades. The reason is because fake charging MB where it is not necessary will stop MB from cooling down, which will affect your timings since you will use MB so much that any cooldown time you can get will help you go faster.

## Fun

- Abusing MB to no end is just a lot of fun.
- Baqlor has a pretty unique main sound which is kind of quite soothing to hear.
- Unfortunately, the main can be frustrating to use because of its interruptible burst nature. If not terminated properly, this will cause the cornermost lasers to go off after exiting MB which is frustrating.

## Trivia

- This ship was used as the first choice of speedrun between versions 4.0 to 5.0, the era when invaders were the densest.
- Many speedrun players say that Baqlor's speedrun is 90% formula and 10% luck, including critical hits and converging.
- New concept of ASMR.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_43_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Fast Charge
- Type: Zen
- Description: High efficiency charge algorithms charge Mega Bomb more quickly.
- Interpretation: The charging time decreases from 2s to 1.75s, the charging time recovery decreases from 4.5s to 3.5s.
- Form: Lambda
- Price: 30000
- Score: 3.80 / 5

Speedrun options limited to unprotected missions. Generally speaking, to clear the mission, use Mega Bomb every other wave. In acts 4 and 5, you can also consider using MB every wave. Facts have proven that if you don't MB more frequently, the bullets will quickly overwhelm you, and even the Chrono Field will not be enough.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_43_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Shield Breaker
- Type: Zen
- Description: Mega Bomb explosion is extra effective against shields.
- Interpretation: Mega Bomb deals 2.5x damage against shields (Fusion core not included).
- Form: Phi
- Price: 45000
- Score: 4.64 / 5

This thing decimates Shield invaders. The insane damage boost of this apex to Shield invaders not only decimate ALL Shield Ravens instantly (due to how easy is it to set up MB anywhere you need), but severely cripples the shields of invaders, requiring only 1 or 2 more bursts of the main to strip them completely for Vultures. The best part is how this apex synergizes so well with its HI weapon, with the SB MB so quickly stripping the shield, allowing crits to be quickly scored and thus destroying even the biggest of invaders so quickly. In fact, it is so powerful, it is even recommended you pull off 2 SB MBs on a Shield Roc, as the SB bonus from SB MB is so humongous that it is faster to use SB MB than to use your main. You can basically think of Phi Baqlor as base Baqlor in Hull, except that it's a bit faster to kill invaders, and you have to watch out for shurikens and pellets that can randomly flood the field. However, the insane speed of killing invaders make deploying CF so easy, that you almost never have a time where you don't have a CF deployed, or even if you do, there is very little left to deal with. Speedrunning in General Shield missions have never been so easy with Phi Baqlor, with it quite easily obtaining a Top 1% in the S4 league without much of a sweat, with only the need to land MBc correctly.
