- Many speedrun players say that Baqlor's speedrun is 90% formula and 10% luck, including critical hits and converging.
- New concept of ASMR.

Speedrun options limited to unprotected missions. Generally speaking, to clear the mission, use Mega Bomb every other wave. In acts 4 and 5, you can also consider using MB every wave. Facts have proven that if you don't MB more frequently, the bullets will quickly overwhelm you, and even the Chrono Field will not be enough.
