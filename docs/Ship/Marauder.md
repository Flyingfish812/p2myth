# Marauder

> I don’t know why, but this appearance reminds me of a paramecium.

## Survival

- Notorious reputation of camping. This ship really loves its personal space. Use Kappa to generate a near unlimited supply of Phalanx and shove bullets away to no end.
- With no need to aim, it is really a perfect camper. This also means not needing to deal with majority of MIRVs.
- Unfortunately, it's lackluster DPS means it can't kill fast and it can easily get overwhelmed from the lack of particles to collect. Being unable to concentrate your firepower to kill one by one also hinders this. Be prepared for long battles.
- When you are cornered, shovel as much as possible, then retreat back to the corner. Rinse and repeat.
- However, the shoveling action may disorientate you and make it difficult to find back the sweet spot where T4 shuriken launchers will not harm you.

## Speedrun

- There's no way you are speedrunning with entirely defensive options and the main that has nearly no optimization to do.

## Fun

- Low DPS and constant Kappa spamming to keep yourself alive means extremely extremely long battles. Not fun.

## Trivia

- Marauder was only introduced into Phoenix 2 at v3.6.
- Marauder is also the name of an invader in Phoenix HD, Phoenix 2's predecessor, which has 2 turrets, identical to a Raven in Phoenix 2. Despite this, there is absolutely no relation in the naming as the dev EL just simply says that the name Marauder is cool.
- Marauder is one of the 4 ships in the game where its apexes have a different thruster configuration/location than its original base form. It is also one of the only 2 ships with both apexes having such different configurations from the base form and each other. The base form has only 2 thrusters, whereas the Alpha Apex has 4 thrusters all lined up in a row, while the Beta Apex has thrusters in a 2×2 configuration.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_76_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Antigrav
- Type: Zen
- Description: Ignore energy particle weight and increase passive attraction power.
- Interpretation: All the particles will be attracted on the same speed and you can absorb energy more easily.
- Form: Alpha
- Price: 5000
- Score: 0.55 / 5

There is nothing to say, the antigrav APEX is almost useless, because you don't need to always attract energy to ensure that the counter is full, and in many cases this will only cause waste. The same goes for any ship with a Kappa Drive APEX.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_76_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Reflector
- Type: Aura
- Description: Lasers reflect on the Phalanx front surface.
- Interpretation: Laser will be reflected to invaders with 10 damage per second.
- Form: Beta
- Price: 10000
- Score: 3.27 / 5

This apex is pretty fun to play with on missions with many lasers like Pellet/Shuriken/Laser missions, but the rather high density of pellets and shurikens mean that you must be careful not to corner yourself while watching Phalanx reflect the lasers back to the invaders. Ensure you can get out of your spot before shurikens and pellets stack on you by shoveling a passageway. Otherwise, it’s pretty safe to just sit there and reflect lasers, and you can even afford a few lanes of incoming pellets so long you replace your Phalanx quickly enough to sustain laser reflect and not die.
