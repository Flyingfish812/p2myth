## Survival

- As a ship with no need to aim, survival is quite important for Lorilou despite its offensive nature since Lorilou isn't very fast per say.
- Lorilou has arguably one of the best synergy overall between all of its main, Aura and Zen.
- Because of its bursty main nature, and the fact that it actually lasts really long, when the first of the 4 shots fires, you can start charging ML. This is particularly useful in the end wave when you know that the burst of 4 shots will kill off the last invaders of the current wave, as you can start charging ML much earlier before the next wave arrives. By the time the next wave arrives, the ML would have definitely finished charging.
- If you are left with one last burst of the main to kill off the rest of the invaders on the current but have too many bullets still around, Phalanx comes in and shields you very well from the last bullets, allowing you to charge ML.
- However, remember that Phalanx does not last long against many bullets, for example, darts coming from a dart spinner. If so, you will need to sacrifice one Phalanx charge. Deploy the Phalanx, and push yourself forward aggressively to clear off the last bullets are then deploy a second Phalanx and start charging ML as the last burst goes off to kill the rest of the invaders.
- With this insane synergy, ML can be used every medium wave and above. The ML covers up for Lorilou's lackluster main DPS. In fact, it is absolutely necessary to abuse ML.
- ML should be also used twice in heavy and/or dense waves. For the second ML, bravely shovel forward once to get rid of as many bullets as you can, then quickly go back down to the bottom of the screen, deploy the second Phalanx and charge ML. Medium waves require only one ML.
- Due to the nature of ML, Lorilou succeeds much better in Unprotected missions with larger invaders, and not many small invaders such as Ravens.
- Lorilou's main is instant tracking which allows you to move anywhere you wish and not risk losing damage.
- When confronted with lasers, use a Phalanx to push yourself above and avoid the lasers. Be careful not to go point blank with dart turrets as not even Phalanx can cover you (due to the gap between the Phalanx and your reactor).
- There are times, when you are already trapped at the extreme side of the field, you have to perform a loop manuveur where needed, going behind all the invaders on field by moving all the way upfield and then going one side to the other. 
- Because of its instant tracking nature, you can't really pop turrets off, which is a flaw when you have to face with all the bullets and lasers.
- Under MIRV/Shuriken missions, one ML is enough to clear off the side that you are on. Camp on that side and let the main do the rest of the work. Your objective is to quickly get rid of all the MIRV Launchers on your side. Staying still will render T4 shuriken launchers useless against you. While on that side, get rid of any bullets by shoveling forward only, not diagonally.
- This will make Lorilou very slow but going over to the other side will cause you to face a lot more MIRVs and deal with the shuriken clouds. Thus, just take it slow.

## Speedrun

- Because you can abuse ML much more than probably any other ship from its insane main-ML synergy, Lorilou is somewhat decent in speedrunning.
- However, it's lackluster main and a non-damaging Aura limits its speed quite severely.

## Fun

- The synergy of its main, Aura and Zen is one of the best things about Lorilou. You can shield yourself and charge ML, while the main does the clean up work. The synergy is very fun to abuse.

## Trivia

- Lorilou was only introduced into Phoenix 2 at v3.3.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_71_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Double Phalanx
- Type: Aura
- Description: A smaller additional Phalanx is placed at the front.
- Interpretation: A Phalanx with half of the original strength and size will be place front.
- Form: Gamma
- Price: 15000
- Score: 2.36 / 5

Having 2 layers of Phalanx for bullets to plow through can make all the difference in being able to pull off an additional ML charge after the initial ML when a wave enters. The prolonging of defences allow two MLs to be pulled off consecutively quite easily.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_71_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Focused Beam
- Type: Zen
- Description: Mega Laser power is concentrated in a smaller beam and deals more damage.
- Interpretation: The width decreased from 150% to 50%, the damage increased from 170 to 200.
- Form: Epsilon
- Price: 25000
- Score: 2.55 / 5

A frustrating to use apex, and can be still difficult to take full advantage of the increased ML damage due to how a majority of waves are dense but not heavy. This means the additional ML damage is still likely to be wasted. However, when faced with waves with Vulture or above behind, they are able to soak up the additional damage from the apex boost. That being said, such waves are quite rare, making this apexâ€™s boost very minimal to such waves.
