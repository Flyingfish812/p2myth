## Trivia

- No trivia, don't stare at me!

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_48_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Twin Lance
- Type: Aura
- Description: Split Vorpal Lance into two projectiles for a larger surface area.
- Interpretation: The surface area is doubled.
- Form: Epsilon
- Price: 25000
- Score: 4.18 / 5

The Twin Lances have always been a very effective reinforcement for Vorpal Lances. One of the major shortcomings of the Gladius is that the only defensive method is the Vorpal Lance, which is used to clear bullets, and the Kappa Drive is only used to allow you to see the bullets clearly. The twin lances can clear a wider space, which is a very effective improvement for the survivability of this ship.
