## Comments

- No2oMe: Please just add it already! I really want to see how it performs in Hull missions.
- No2oMe: Try to position it on the left side of the screen—its targeting prioritizes right-side enemy turrets, which often causes missed shots.
- S.K.: Have you tried flying this Raven like an Invader? No? Good—it’s absolutely terrible!


## Speedrun
- Face the invader and shoot with your darts, activate the shield when energy is full, then charge the laser for maximum output.
- The Captured Raven's main weapon resembles a downgraded Antioch, significantly impairing its combat performance. Optimal damage output requires near point-blank engagement distances.
- Fortunately, its projectiles travel very slowly, which makes prefiring setups possible.
- The Main Weapon always prioritizes aiming at the enemy’s right-side turret. This means that if you’re positioned directly in front, even slight enemy movement will cause you to miss. That’s why many players find it hard to use. In fact, staying on the left or right side of the screen and keeping yourself parallel with the enemy neatly solves this problem.
- The Captured Raven’s Zen is basically a weakened version of a Tracking Minigun, but thanks to the properties of its laser, it can be used to sweep through stages. More often, though, it should be treated as a burst output tool: once the cooldown ends, move to the lower part of the screen, fire zen, and then quickly reposition to keep the laser aligned with the enemy—or with the spot where the next wave will spawn.

## Survival
- The Captured Raven’s Aura is fairly strong—essentially a small shield that moves with you, or a formation with no blind spots in all directions—and it has enough durability to let you weave freely through bullet patterns for about half a screen’s duration.
- Unfortunately, the Aura has no durability indicator, which means it can suddenly break without warning. It’s recommended to absorb enough energy while the Aura is active to ensure you can chain into the next one smoothly.
- When the Captured Raven’s Aura is activated, it does not clear bullets already inside its area. So when using the Aura, be mindful of bullets that are stuck close to your hitbox.

## Fun
- The Captured Raven’s main weapon can be quite frustrating, as its projectile speed is painfully slow. Thankfully, the high-damage Zen helps make up for this shortcoming.
- The feeling of weaving through bullet patterns while carrying a small shield that doesn’t vanish right away is very satisfying.
- The sound effect when firing Zen is also pleasant to hear.

## Trivia:
- It may be the largest playable craft in the game.
- It is the only craft in the game that does not sway left or right, and the only craft in the game whose core position is not indicated in its display model.
- It is one of the few crafts that feature movable parts on the body. Its Main Weapon and Zen laser can rotate a full 360 degrees.
