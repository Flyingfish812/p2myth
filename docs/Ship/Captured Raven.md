## Comments

- No2oMe: Please just add it already! I really want to see how it performs in Hull missions.
- No2oMe: Try to position it on the left side of the screen—its targeting prioritizes right-side enemy turrets, which often causes missed shots.
- S.K.: Have you tried flying this Raven like an Invader? No? Good—it’s absolutely terrible!


## Speedrun
- Face the invader and shoot with your darts, activate the shield when energy is full, then charge the laser for maximum output.
- The Captured Raven's main weapon resembles a downgraded Antioch, significantly impairing its combat performance. Optimal damage output requires near point-blank engagement distances.
