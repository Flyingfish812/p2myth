## Survival

- As a ship with no need to care about aiming, all you need to care about is dodging.
- SEMP is used as per standard, either at the start of the wave (especially when there's lots of Sparrows!), or just before lasers and spinners are about to go off.
- TP helps you get in position to maximize a SEMP that is not full and hit as many turrets and invaders as possible, TP in the middle of the action and launch it.
- While the invaders are stunned, this allows you to move around with better freedom. Use this chance to try and maximize the main weapon. If the main weapon is aimed at a bigger invader such as a Heron or above, try to line it up with a Sparrow or Raven such that the smaller invaders go down quickly. Target switching for Czar takes time and you lose DPS.
- In particular, in daily missions, due to the poor DPS of Czar, it is important you concentrate all the main damage onto Ravens and clear the field of as many turrets as possible. Leave the larger invaders for last. After Ravens, destroy the Herons, and then the Eagles, and finally the Vulture.
- Particle management is extremely important for Czar, as a bit lesser will result in lesser stun time which may mean you may run out of time to eliminate invaders before they start firing again. Don't allow SEMP to overfill, launch it just before it reaches full.
- TP will then take care of the rest of your survival against larger invaders.
- Unfortunately, Czar has a pretty horrible targeting system and this makes turret popping extremely unpredictable, so don't count on it to pop turrets. There is just absolutely no way you can direct the main to hit the turret you want.
- Use SEMP to reset spinners and MIRV Bloomers to cover for Czar's weakness of turret popping, even if the SEMP is pretty small.

## Speedrun

- There's just no way you are speedrunning with the lowest DPS in the game, and a Zen that doesn't do damage. The Aura does help to clear out Sparrows, but the main DPS is so low there's just no way this ship is going fast.
- Fortunately, in daily missions, the presence of dense waves which allow for many SEMPs to be fired gives it a slight bit of speed.

## Fun

- The only fun in this ship is using SEMP to wipe out a whole bunch of Sparrows. Otherwise there's nothing fun about this ship, plus the main can get annoying when it targets the wrong things.
- Czar is a ship that works, but it's just extremely boring to play.
- Utilizing the characteristic of locking onto targets with the main weapon allows for Teleporting to the opposite side with more invaders to perform a "rubber band".

## Trivia

- Czar used to be one of the most reliable ships to clear missions before the v3.5 update due to the powerful SEMP that lasted a whole 5 seconds. However, ever since the SEMP nerf, it has sadly fallen out of meta, although it is still viable.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_21_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Explosive Arrival
- Type: Zen
- Description: Arrival EMP has been modulated to also deal damage to Invaders in its range.
- Interpretation: Deals 30 damage to Invaders within a range of 50 from the arrival point.
- Form: Lambda
- Price: 30000
- Score: 4.27 / 5

This apex is INSANELY FUN! The SEMP + TP combo makes Ravens instantly disappear like no tomorrow. In fact you need only a very small SEMP to kill these Ravens, you don’t even need to conserve it. Since Czar is quite free to go where it pleases due to SEMP, you don’t really need TP when stun is in effect. Thus, you can abuse TP for damage to no tomorrow, destroying any smaller invaders, including Herons very fast. The most ideal way to deal with Herons is to get the main to target an Eagle or larger, then double TP onto the Heron(s). 2 TPs with a bit more of the main will kill it so quickly, they don’t even stand a chance. All you left is a lone Vulture or some Eagles where you can lead them on a wild goose chase, circling the entire playing field with no chance for it to do anything to you except when they have spinners or bloomers, in which case, just stun them, but be careful to reserve some SEMP (half of the full size will do fine) for the next wave. You can then just wear down their health by popping in an occasional TP. Usually 2 TP is enough so that TP has chance to cool for the next wave. The only situation where it’ll struggle a bit more is when there are only Eagles or higher in that wave, in that case, it’ll function like normal Czar.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_21_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Double Teleport
- Type: Zen
- Description: Enables an instant charge for a second Teleport directly upon arrival.
- Interpretation: The charging for the second Teleport will be completed instantly after the first one.
- Form: Delta
- Price: 20000
- Score: 2.00 / 5

This apex is super stressful. The primary objective of this apex seems to be optimisation of the wonky main, using the increased number of Teleports to line yourself up with smaller invaders such as Ravens and Sparrows that are clearly not targeted by the main’s wonky targeting system. Because it’s so hard to read what target is the main actually aiming at, optimisation of this apex is extremely difficult and thus, this apex still makes optimisation a real pain. Beyond the initial first few Acts, this apex really is just an increased defence against MIRVs and darts like other ships with this apex.
