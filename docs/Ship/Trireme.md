## Survival

- Despite its low main DPS, the main bulk of its damage is dealt through MS.
- The main's only purpose is to strip the invaders of their shield. This works better in heavier waves such as those with Eagles. Get nearer to Eagles instead of Ravens and Sparrows to quickly strip their shield and finish them off with MS so that many of the deadly turrets will be gone first.
- Unfortunately, this is very difficult in the presence of dense waves since there are just too many shields to strip. In such cases, it is simply better to just fire MS without caring. After all, you will get back another full MS from destroying the smaller Ravens.
- Despite the instant tracking main, Trireme actually needs to flail around a lot, this is to get closer to its intended targets to deploy MS on.
- Trireme succeeds in dart dodging very well due to its TP. A very common technique to employ is to go to the upper corner of the field, swipe across from one end to another, and then TP down. This distracts dart turrets to fire upwards instead of downwards. This technique is very useful when the screen is getting flooded by MIRVs and shurikens.
- You will require a lot of TP-ing as you need to distract dart tracking turrets a LOT. It's a lot of hit-and-run emphasis, once you TP, fire MS.
- Although not frequent, you sometimes need to TP into the thick of the action to fire off MS so that MS can lock on to as many targets as possible, in order not to waste MS. However, since MS kicks into action later, most invaders would be dead after the MS which allows you to collect most of their particles, fulfilling your Aura to a pretty huge size already. This is why it's a less frequent occurrence. However, there are times where you might want to fire off smaller MS to quickly clear one part of the field to be designated your safe zone you can TP back to. Be also very careful as dense waves run a real risk of turret collision.
- Unfortunately, Trireme will fare quite bad in a densely populated dart field where there is very little time to think where to position yourself correctly to prepare for the next TP. A lot of practice is needed to understand TP departure techniques as the wrong positioning before charging up TP can put you point blank at a dart tracking turret.
- The best option is to get nearer or inbetween spread or tracking lasers as those don't fire very often. Just be careful to start your TP departure before the lasers start to charge up (the laser sound cue).

## Speedrun

- Trireme has absolutely zero damage spill when used right, since MS can retarget and bigger invaders (Vulture and above) don't go down even with their shield down and after one full MS burst on them.
- When faced with Herons and Eagles, make sure their shield is completely stripped away before firing MS. The same applies for Vultures. Generally you would want to group MS usage into: Small invaders, larger invaders which are Herons and Eagles, and finally the "boss" invaders which are Vulture and above. If there are only Herons, then Herons can be grouped with the Vulture.
- For further optimization, if there are a lot of Ravens (6 and above), wait for the main to cycle through all of them (or almost of them) before firing off an MS.

## Fun

- Trireme's main is very satisfying to hear in action. The burst pulsar is very cool to watch as it randomly chooses a new target after the previous hit.
- Trireme is very stress free in some sense as none of its offensive means (the main and Aura) require aiming, only MS requires locking on but it's pretty automatic.
- Speedrunning with Trireme is also very fun due to the flailing around needed.

## Trivia

- Trireme was one of the most overpowered ships back in v1.0, due to the overpowered MS.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_17_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Double Teleport
- Type: Zen
- Description: Enables an instant charge for a second Teleport directly upon arrival.
- Interpretation: The charging for the second Teleport will be completed instantly after the first one.
- Form: Tau
- Price: 40000
- Score: 2.00 / 5

Landing safe teleports can be really tricky at times due to the mess of bullets heading in all directions, and this is when the second TP helps to resolve this by letting you use the first one as a scouting TP. You can also use it as a true peek-a-boo where you can teleport upfield, immediately release MS, and then come back down for safety (perhaps after the dart tracking turrets have locked on to you and fired). This requires some practice as you only have a very brief period of time after your first TP to release MS, otherwise the 2nd TP is cancelled.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_17_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Armor Piercing
- Type: Aura
- Description: Reinforced warheads allow these missiles to pierce enemy armor.
- Interpretation: The missiles ignore 30% damage reduction of armors.
- Form: Gamma
- Price: 15000
- Score: 4.82 / 5

This apex can be quite fun to bring out on Armor Laser missions as it can teleport freely around the field to avoid all the lasers and spam MS. However, unless you really love Trireme, there are significantly better options out there which are more fun and more viable compared to this apex.
