## Survival

- The infinite SEMP spam ship. As the main Meson Laser fires, release your touch to engage Kappa to charge up a large SEMP. Disengage Kappa once the lasers stop firing. Obviously, don't do it when your Aura is already full.
- The infinite SEMP allows you a lot of flexibility to move around.
- If there are invaders hiding behind larger invaders like Vultures or Eagles, use SEMP, then go behind and quickly take out the pesky cowards. This allows you to refill your Aura quickly.
- It's not always possible to kill a Vulture before it fires its spinners, even after the initial SEMP. In this case, you should wait just before the spinners (it's also fine to let it fire a bit usually) before firing the second SEMP. Just remember to kill off all the smaller invaders before that happens to gain back sufficient Aura to cover both spinners.
- The main can be very annoying to aim. It sometimes dedicates so many lasers to one Sparrow, wasting a ton of DPS. To minimize this, after that Sparrow is dead, try to readjust yourself such that it hits the largest invader on field such as a Vulture.
- Oran will involve a lot of running around to avoid being under turret fire. Position yourself upfield behind larger invaders such as Herons and Eagles to take them out quickly before they can flood the field.
- Oran generates quite a lot of particles by itself through the use of Kappa, since the rhythm is easy to follow which results in great Kappa usage which generates a lot of particles. Unless when faced with dart turrets, it is not a necessity to eliminate Ravens. Instead, focus all attention on eliminating the larger invaders. These larger invaders take time for their turrets to turn around (if it's not a dart turret, of course), which allow you to launch smaller SEMPs to continually disrupt them even as the initial SEMP wears off.
- Aiming at Ravens is sometimes not a good idea due to main leakage which happens after the Ravens die and the main continues to fire. Thus, it is better to use against larger invaders and take them out first. Ravens will get destroyed through the use of your SEMPs, or at the end of a wave where they are usually less dangerous.
- If there are dart tracking turrets, however, then staying below will usually benefit you better, destroying invaders from smaller to larger sizes.

## Speedrun

- The infinite SEMP spam means that quite a lot of wide but small AoE damage can be done, making it slightly speedy for crowded missions that feature lots of Ravens and Sparrows.
- Optimizing when to use SEMP is of absolute key in earlier waves. A slightly delayed SEMP to charge more Aura from Kappa makes all the difference in killing Sparrows or not. Be sure to abuse Kappa as much as you can in early waves as the SEMP damage will wipe Sparrows clean.

## Fun

- Seeing the Meson Lasers target different invaders/turrets is a sight to behold.
- The synergy of the main and Kappa is very fun to abuse, as the Meson laser fires, let go. Then when the lasers die down, prepare to fire off the next set of lasers. It's a rhythm basically, and who doesn't like to keep in beat?

## Trivia

- Oran is one of the 3 ships that has nonstop fans (Oran, Stinger, Tillat'Or).
- It's main weapon used to be 21.25 DPS before the v3.5 update.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_14_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Antigrav
- Type: Zen
- Description: Ignore energy particle weight and increase passive attraction power.
- Interpretation: All the particles will be attracted on the same speed and you can absorb energy more easily.
- Form: Beta
- Price: 10000
- Score: 0.55 / 5

This apex helps for heavier waves, where you sometimes need to quickly fire another round of SEMP again before invaders start flooding the field with bullets, especially after a larger invader such as Herons or Eagles are destroyed.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_14_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Meson Controller
- Type: Main Weapon
- Description: Advanced targeting and power control allow Meson Lasers to reload and switch targets more efficiently.
- Interpretation: nan
- Form: Delta
- Price: 20000
- Score: 3.00 / 5

This apex upgrades the main weapon such that there is absolute zero leakage in DPS. Meson Lasers that killed Invaders before the burst ends will be redirected into a new burst that is separate from the initial burst. This also means that the rhythm of the Meson Lasers can be thrown off slightly, although the timing between the first and last burst fired off is generally not more than 1s off.

This upgrades Oran pretty significantly and makes it much easier to use, as you no longer need to attempt to redirect the burst by re-positioning yourself towards another invader. It makes optimization on Oran much easier and also the zero leakage of the instant tracking weapon means a lot less frustration with Oran. However, some of the Meson lasers go out of sync more often than base Oran. This makes abusing the main-Kappa synergy a bit more difficult as there is less time in between all 3 bursts and the next round of bursts to use Kappa. However, the off-sync is small and usually still quite manageable.
