## Survival

- PD is primarily used as an offensive tool to get up close to invaders to maximize damage from the main.
- However, be very careful about being shot at point blank by being right in front of a turret. It's a good idea to always offset yourself slightly to one side of the turret and spam PD to stay alive. This might make one side of the main not hit completely but this is fine.
- Use PD to clear enough bullets to ensure a safe setup for ML in the next wave. Bear in mind you may not have enough to completely clean the field after using up a lot of PD for the earlier part of the wave.
- Unfortunately Arietis extremely wide spread main means it's impossible to pop turrets off. You just have to rely on ML to clear things out quite fast, and use PD as a backup.
- Arietis takes time (~1s, yes, the transition is quite long) to transit back from charging MLs to firing its main again, which is a bummer since DPS is lost.
- In MIRV/Shuriken missions, where there are less shuriken launchers, Arietis can be viable. Simply charge ML and make sure it hits the Eagles that carry these turrets.
- If there are more than one Eagles that carry shuriken launchers, you will have to fire ML twice that wave. ML clears bullets which allows you to get past the shuriken cloud. Using PD to clear out the shuriken cloud will very quickly cause you to be severely backed into a corner.
- With shuriken launchers eliminated, aggressively use PD to eliminate MIRVs before they even get to explode.
- It is a common mistake to push up aggressively to eliminate these MIRVs. Instead, slowly push yourself up after an ML is fired so that you can collect the particles and give time for the Aura to increase in size and eliminate the MIRVs before they get into explosion range.

## Speedrun

- PD is meant to be used as an offensive tool, constantly spamming it so that you can get up close to the invaders and deal maximum damage, otherwise a sit back playstyle will result in not enough damage being done.
- Because of its close up gameplay and thus utilizing much of its DPS, Arietis has the capability to go quite fast.
- However, when faced with larger invaders such as Vultures, the extremely wide spread main means that it is inevitable that the corner streams leak, wasting some DPS.
- Because of the fact Arietis is a very close combat playstyle, especially when it comes to clearing the smaller invaders behind, after clearing out the wave, it is extremely awkward since you need to quickly swipe all the way back down (as well as using PD to absolutely ensure the safe swipe since there is really no time to waste) just to charge ML.
- ML should be used every medium wave or above to clear invaders out faster, thus making the playing field less crowded with bullets. The aggressive usage of PD to ensure a safe charge of ML is thus important.

## Fun

- Using PD to consistently clear bullets gives the very satisfying PD sounds at nearly all times.
- Arietis is a ship with a very "in your face" playstyle, where you literally shove all your firepower right in their face. Take that, invaders!

## Trivia

- Arietis' main used to be one of the loudest in the game before it was toned down in a subsequent update. (Loud, very loud!)

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_31_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Bullet Detonator
- Type: Aura
- Description: Enemy bullets are detonated dealing Blast damage.
- Interpretation: Each detonated bullet deals 2 AOE damage.
- Form: Lambda
- Price: 30000
- Score: 4.18 / 5

Due to the aggressive style of Arietis, constantly spamming PD to get closer to invaders and shoving the main right in their face, the bullet detonator apex works very well for Arietis as you would spare no effort in saving PD anyway, so might as well PD be used for something even more useful, dealing damage to all types of invaders.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_31_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Focused Beam
- Type: Zen
- Description: Mega Laser power is concentrated in a smaller beam and deals more damage.
- Interpretation: The width decreased from 150% to 50%, the damage increased from 170 to 200.
- Form: Epsilon
- Price: 25000
- Score: 2.55 / 5

The increase in damage for ML helps to plow through larger invaders much faster, so that less MIRVs are being pumped into the field, which allows PD to keep up with eliminating MIRVs even before they explode. It also allows for desperate ML riding where the massive graze from the mess of bullets can allow it to regain some PD when threatened with too many shuriken launchers. This is particularly demonstrated in 5-4.
