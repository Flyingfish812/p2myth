## Survival

- Uhb has a slightly narrow targeting cone which sometimes makes targets hard to hit. It will attempt to hit a target outside its cone, however, but you need to shift yourself closer to the target to hit.
- Unfortunately, it is also this targeting mechanism that makes Ravens and sometimes even Sparrows leave the laser since the laser lasts for quite a while, but the laser does not change its angle once it fires. The lackluster DPS of Uhb also mean that the lasers don't really do a lot of damage.
- The only real survivability for Uhb comes from its REMP.
- Because of the way the main works, given it's instant tracking and also the fact that it is not one laser but several individual lasers, it is very difficult to direct the blast laser to pop turrets off, which becomes an issue.
- In very dense (and heavy) waves, it's best to offset to one side of the field to charge REMP since turret collision becomes a real issue.
- Although REMP is an adequate defence against boomerangs, the radius of REMP is not enough to cover boomerangs from higher tier boomerang turrets. In addition, boomerangs can come in very fast, so be careful to strafe to avoid boomerangs since REMP does not cool quickly.

## Speedrun

- The MS + REMP is a very potent combination when pulled off right, especially in crowds. Unfortunately, it is not easy to pull off in Unprotected missions due to the fast pace of the mission type.
- Open up a wave with an REMP (only when there are sufficient Ravens and Sparrows around obviously), and at the correct location (go behind larger invaders if you have to), then immediately fire off an MS. Be precise about the timing because a delayed REMP when darts start to fire can mean immediate death since you are in the middle of the action.
- The MS should had been sufficiently large enough from the previous waves (other than in early Acts) to destroy the damaged Ravens as well as continue on to target larger invaders.
- In early Acts, it may be more beneficial to spam launch small size MS since the main damage is lackluster, adding on to the fact that the main is not very reliable.
- Basically, the main is nothing more than a support, with MS + REMP doing the main bulk of damage.
- While very dangerous, you can try to release REMP in the middle of the field even in dense (and heavy) waves. There is a chance that there will be a turret collision. However, releasing MS after REMP will reduce that chance.
- Be careful when releasing MS in the middle of the field. Do not be on top of any invader when doing this, otherwise some damage might be wasted from overkill damage as the missiles all get absorbed by that invader on top of you.

## Fun

- Speedrunning with Uhb is quite fun, as a well-pulled off REMP + MS combo wrecks crowds very quickly.
- The blast laser can get frustrating however, since it is lackluster in damage and expect small invaders to just slip past its aiming.

## Trivia

- Uhb was only introduced into Phoenix 2 at v2.5.
- It was initially thought that the spelling U-H-B was supposed to be some kind of unknown acronym before the v5.0 update, and thus all 3 letters were thought to be UPPER CASE. This was not only because Uhb as a word sounds weird, but all ship names in the game were in UPPER CASE before the v5.0 update. After the v5.0 update however, the actual casing of the individual letters now appear in the shop under the Warp Gate tab.
- However, the proper casing of Uhb was never quite noticed. While I as the guide author noticed this the first time it popped up, I assumed that it was a mistake, but one that was too trivial to raise it up to the devs.
- Eventually, someone on the Reddit brought up this issue and provided an insight which made sense and I finally decided the reasoning was sound enough for the casing of Uhb in the shop to be justified. Some pronunciations of Uhb has since been suggested, such as "Ub" and "chub". The link to this thread is as follows: https://redd.it/escxxz

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_63_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: High Explosive
- Type: Aura
- Description: Missiles equipped with advanced warheads deal blast damage on impact.
- Interpretation: Missiles deal 1 AOE damage within 50 range.
- Form: Delta
- Price: 20000
- Score: 2.18 / 5

The close combat fighting style of Uhb makes the Explosive MS Apex extremely potent, quickly dealing respectable blast damage especially in the new crowded meta. Very dense waves get decimated very quickly when MS is launched in the middle of the screen.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_63_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Extended Range
- Type: Zen
- Description: Improved amplifiers increase the EMP range.
- Interpretation: The max range increases from 225 to 280.
- Form: Epsilon
- Price: 25000
- Score: 3.00 / 5

A lifesaving apex, the increase in clearance range allow Uhb to quickly strafe to the other side in order to avoid the insane number of boomerangs in General/Boomerang missions. The increased range is just barely enough to avoid T4 Boomerang barrages. The increase range also deals more AoE damage to invaders since it can now cover more ground.
