## Survival

- No defence at all. Straight firing weapon makes it all the worse.

## Speedrun

- Because of the really long duration of its main, it synergizes extremely well with MB and LS. While the main and LS are firing to take out the last of the invaders, start charging MB (after correct positioning, always wait for the tracking dart turrets to fire first). When the next wave comes in, even if it has Ravens coming in first, the MB is immediately ready to fire.
- Use LS as the wave begins (after the MB goes off), and excess Aura energy from the many dead Ravens can be reserved for near the end of the wave to chain LS and main together and start charging an MB as mentioned above.
- It is unfortunate, however, that LS just doesn't deal enough damage (and quickly enough as well) to make Buhloo amongst the top speedrunners, but it is one ship that can occupy the top spots in the right hands, though it will never be BoB worthy.

## Fun

- As a speedrunning ship, it is indeed pretty fun.
- Buhloo is one of the smallest ships in the game in terms of physical size, and thus has an extremely easy to grasp reactor position.

## Trivia

- Buhloo was one of the OP ships back in v1.0, constantly occupying the top spots, where LS & MB was OP as well. Not to mention, the long firing main was also the reason for this, as chaining MB and LS with the main was an insane combo. Furthermore, there were no charge increase times for zens back in v1.0, making MB very abusable.
- Another reason for why Buhloo was so OP back in v1.0 is because back then, while Aura is in use, the main would stop firing. The thing is, Buhloo didn't care, as once the main started to fire, it won't stop even as LS goes off. There would be a little bit of downtime as the last of LS goes off, but the penalty wasn't that bad considering how OP LS was back in v1.0.
- Buhloo has the longest burst in the game, at 2000ms.

## APEX 1

- Name: High Power
- Type: Aura
- Description: A constellation of Laser Moons outputs all damage in less time.

- Form: Epsilon
- Price: 25000
- Score: 3.36 / 5

As a speedrunning ship with absolutely no defence at all, this apex boosts it speed even further, bringing it closer on par with its MS counterpart. Because of the insane synergy Buhloo has with its LS, main and MB, it can be slightly harder to pull off due to the decrease in LS duration. However, the main usually makes up for this. Just make sure that if you need to charge MB for the next wave, only use LS if the last invaders are smaller invaders such as Herons and below, otherwise it can be easy to miss the last invaders and waste some time trying to chase them down. This also depends on what's coming up in the next wave as larger invaders in front mean more time for MB to charge.

## APEX 2

- Name: Extended Range
- Type: Zen
- Description: More potent energy particles increase the blast range.
- Interpretation: The max radius increases from 400 to 500.
- Form: Gamma
- Price: 15000
- Score: 3.18 / 5

Gamma Buhloo's presence is very low, because the bonus brought by Laser Storm's High Power APEX is too efficient. Most of the time, you don't need to be at the bottom to charge bombs, because you can take advantage of the long duration of the main weapon to make full use of this time to charge bombs. Once again, you can also choose to finish a wave with Laser Storm and use this time to charge up a bomb in the middle of the screen. In short, it doesn't have the difficulty of charging bombs like the Wraith, so this APEX is not that necessary.
