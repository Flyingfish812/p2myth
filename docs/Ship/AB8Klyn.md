## Comments

- Dark骑士: If you cannot clear a mission without darts, boomerangs, and lasers, then it's right to use it. It can survive nearly all regular bullet hells, and it's very friendly to beginners. Delta Klyn is the easiest ship to earn credits, but it has a slow clearing speed.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_72_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: High Damage
- Type: Zen
- Description: Energy actuators increase the damage of the EMP.
- Interpretation: The damage increases from 20 to 30.
- Form: Sigma
- Price: 35000
- Score: 4.91 / 5

This APEX enhances Klyn's speedrun potential. Like most other ships with this APEX, it requires you to fly into the middle of a group of invaders before using Reflex EMP. In specialist missions, it generally performs well, because all the main projectiles hitting the invaders can cause a lot of critical damage, but the price is that you must use Point Defense reasonably to protect yourself when the Reflex EMP's cooldown is not completed. In addition, when you need to face the Laser SPAM mission, you need to give Point Defense the priority to eliminating the laser MIRVs, and your strategy should be killing from the back row to the front row.
