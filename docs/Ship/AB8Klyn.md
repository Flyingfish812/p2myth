## Comments

- Dark骑士: If you cannot clear a mission without darts, boomerangs, and lasers, then it's right to use it. It can survive nearly all regular bullet hells, and it's very friendly to beginners. Delta Klyn is the easiest ship to earn credits, but it has a slow clearing speed.

## Survival

- In General/Boomerang missions, REMP can be used when you are out of PD. After an REMP is used, push forward as far as possible to collect as much particles as possible before retreating again.
- You can also use REMP if sufficient time has passed. This is especially so since the high damaging main can cause a constant particle flow in daily missions which keeps PD healthy.
- REMP is also used at the start of a wave to deal as much damage to frontline invaders where possible.
- You can comfortably use another REMP after 6 bursts of the main.
- In MIRV/Shuriken missions, PD can be used to eliminate the first wave of MIRVs.
- REMP can be used to eliminate most of the shuriken cloud that comes in afterwards. Subsequent MIRV waves can be dealt with by PD. After using REMP defensively to eliminate enough of the shuriken cloud, go up to the invaders that have these shuriken launchers and take them out fast. At close enough range, you can thus spam PD to eliminate MIRVs before they get the chance to explode.
- Because of AB8's main spread, it is difficult to pop turrets. It is not of much issue as AB8 has a more sit back playstyle where you are often at the bottom of the screen.
- Lasers are its biggest weakness since it has no means to deal with them. You have to use PD to plow through enough bullets to strafe fast enough.

## Speedrun

- The highly damaging main allows AB8 to go pretty fast. Coupled with the fact that the spread is not exactly very wide, it's not too hard to land nearly all the projectiles on some invader.
- AB8's main is actually pretty slow moving. Thus, when opening up a wave with REMP, start from the bottom of the field, then quickly swipe up to position yourself as central as you can in the invader pattern and charge REMP. The main will hit the invaders together with the REMP, dealing extra damage as opposed to simply preparing yourself upfield before the invaders arrive.
- After which, you can quickly use PD to aid your way back to the bottom of the field. The REMP then PD combo works very well for AB8, especially in speedrunning.
- For easier missions, you can even go right up to the invaders in close combat and shove your main right onto them. Just be careful not to stand too near to dart tracking turrets.
- For Ravens and Sparrows, stand slightly further back, but inbetween them so that you can hit them all together. PD can be used to rapidly change sides and destroy the other side quickly. This applies more for light waves.

## Fun

- AB8's main is pretty fun to watch in action.
- REMP also makes for some pretty tasty AoE damage.
- PD is also great to hear in action.

## Trivia

- AB8/Klyn was only introduced into Phoenix 2 at v3.3.
- AB8/Klyn is a 2 part name thought of by the dev EL.
- According to him, AB8/Klyn looks like a human ship, and he wanted a name that sounds like something humans could make up. And given us humans, we like to nickname long names.
- The name AB8/Klyn sounds fluid as it is easy to pronounce. According to EL, AB8 is pronounced as aaj biiii 8.
- The second part of the name Klyn was supposed to be longer, but it was shortened to a single syllable because it sounded better with the first part of the name AB8. It is not clear what the longer name was.
- There were even reddit discussions about how to pronounce AB8/Klyn. Someone there pronounced it as Brooklyn. One of the discussion threads is this link as follows:
- It was also teased by EL that Klyn is a reference to a space battle where its predecessor played a pivotal role, so it was sort of an homage. However, it was just made up on the spot when this question was asked.
- It was also teased that AB8 is the successor to the AB6, which was a very successful, but ageing attack ship. Coincidentally it launched around the same time as the AB9, successor to the AB5, which is the sleeker brother, more aimed at intercepting. Similarly, it was just made up on the spot when this question was asked.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_72_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: High Damage
- Type: Zen
- Description: Energy actuators increase the damage of the EMP.
- Interpretation: The damage increases from 20 to 30.
- Form: Sigma
- Price: 35000
- Score: 4.91 / 5

This APEX enhances Klyn's speedrun potential. Like most other ships with this APEX, it requires you to fly into the middle of a group of invaders before using Reflex EMP. In specialist missions, it generally performs well, because all the main projectiles hitting the invaders can cause a lot of critical damage, but the price is that you must use Point Defense reasonably to protect yourself when the Reflex EMP's cooldown is not completed. In addition, when you need to face the Laser SPAM mission, you need to give Point Defense the priority to eliminating the laser MIRVs, and your strategy should be killing from the back row to the front row.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_72_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: EMP Laser
- Type: Aura
- Description: Destroyed bullets trigger a small Bullet EMP.
- Interpretation: Laser Beams decreased from 10 to 1, but a Bullet EMP of range 50 will be activated each time.
- Form: Delta
- Price: 20000
- Score: 3.45 / 5

This apex makes any affinity of MIRV/Shuriken mission a total cakewalk, no matter how difficult the mission may be. You just need to tap to use PD whenever you feel the need to. The energy usage of this apex is so efficient due to how many bullets are there on field, and how the depletion of Aura is quite minimal. To reduce usage even further, just pop in an REMP every now and then (ensuring it's sufficiently cooled down, which shouldn't be a problem). The REMP also helps in clearing invaders faster from the AoE damage it provides to eliminate Ravens faster. It is so easy to gain enough Aura purely by grazing even in the very rare case you run out of Aura, which is something so easy to do with so many bullets around. While you can simply take it very easy and simply rhythmically tap to use BEMP PD to get an easy clear, it is also possible to get decent times with this apex by using it more aggressively to set yourself up for better REMP positions for maximum AoE damage.
