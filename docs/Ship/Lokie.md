## Comments

- 圆锥曲线: Prefire or close combat, that is a problem.

## Survival

- PS means it is great for its mission type to reflect off lasers.
- Lokie is a slow burner. The slow moving projectiles allow it to stack damage slowly upon invaders.
- Shurikens are one of Lokie's biggest weaknesses. PS is a great tool when you are faced with a shuriken cloud headed toward you with very little space to escape, simply use it and then quickly Phase Out past the shuriken cloud.
- PS is a very useful tool in Pellet/Shuriken/Laser missions with MIRV Deathonators as well, since PS can get rid of these pellets released by MIRV Deathonators.
- Because of Lokie's spread, it is difficult to pop off turrets from invaders. However, it is possible to go point blank range with a Vulture's turrets to take out 2 turrets on one side.
- Because Lokie's main is slow, it is often confined to the bottom of the screen. In this regard, make sure your LS is almost full before launching it as you won't be able to have LS deal damage to invaders.

## Speedrun

- Because of its slow moving projectiles, you should try to retreat to the very bottom of the screen between waves, and definitely between Acts so that you can build up damage.
- When the first wave of an Act arrives, in early Acts, you should advance forward with the tremor field briefly in order to kill off Sparrows quickly before they start scattering everywhere.
- In daily missions, because Lokie's main will slowly kill off the invaders upfield, but you will be stuck at the bottom of the screen, you will be faced with a lot of particles upfield as the wave comes down to the last few invaders. In this case, you can then use another LS to finish off these invaders while you head upfield to collect particles, speeding things up since chasing down the last invaders with your slow moving main will waste time.

## Fun

- It's really fun to build up projectiles on screen. Tremor Field looks awesome on field.
- One fun thing you can do is to advance forward with the projectiles, creating a nice blanket of projectiles.
- Everything (except PS) about Lokie is golden...literally. The ship is gold, the tremor field is gold, and so is LS.

## Trivia

- In the first act, it is generally most efficient to just hold still, and any movement will cause distortion.
- Staying still like a tortoise.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_49_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Supersize
- Type: Zen
- Description: Aegis amplifiers create an extra large Personal Shield.
- Interpretation: The size of the Personal Shield is increased by 50%.
- Form: Alpha
- Price: 5000
- Score: 2.00 / 5

This is actually a very impressive improvement to Lokie, not only being able to catch more lasers, but to also improve its survivability by quite a fair margin. Abused correctly, you can use this to get yourself out of tight situations such as a mess of darts, or even to eliminate MIRV pellets. The only problem with this apex is, the reactor is a blinking blue dot, and the whole ship is pretty much blue as well, making it hard to see the reactor, making this apex quite difficult to pilot at times, especially in tight situations.

## APEX 2

- Name: High Power
- Type: Aura
- Description: A constellation of Laser Moons outputs all damage in less time.
- Interpretation: The laser moons increases from 5 to 8, the max duration decreases from 4.5s to 2.25s.
- Form: Delta
- Price: 20000
- Score: 3.36 / 5

The combination of its slow moving deadly Tremor Field that floods the field together with a supercharged LS allow Lokie to kill impressively fast. The shortened duration of LS also allows Lokie to dispose of its particles fast enough in that there is significantly less particle wastage, especially when particles can come in fast in dense waves.
