## Survival

- The only survivability comes from its VL. This allows some last minute escape from misaligned darts.
- VL can also be used to pop turrets off since Ravens are generally not an issue from MB (and it's Hull so they all die immediately). But if you find trouble in charging MB, then VL is an option.
- Pure speed is what keeps it alive. It’s MB will wipe Ravens out immediately which is what gives it survivability. Unfortunately positioning of where to charge MB is a real issue due to fast moving bullets.

## Speedrun

- Wraith's main weapon has a cycle of 1.2s. Use this fact to optimize your main weapon.
- Wraith's main weapon takes quite some time to get used to. It is best seen as a slider. You start from one side, then slowly sweep to the other side as invaders on the side you start from goes down.
- Optimization of the main is important but annoying in early waves. Under normal circumstances, one burst of the main will eliminate a Sparrow and a Raven. It is also capable of clearing up to typically 4 Sparrows (in a Sparrow heavy wave).
- However, the most annoying thing about Wraith is when its main weapon crits. Under crit circumstances, it will eliminate 2 Ravens, while under normal circumstances, it will only eliminate 1 and damage the other Raven.
- The crit of Wraith is also very annoying as one burst under crit will eliminate a turret, while one normal burst will not.
- Thus, you must have a lot of experience with Wraith, and react very quickly the very instance you hear the crit sound.
- Wraith is first in its class for crowd control. Both VL and MB allows for some insane crowd clearing capabilities.
- MB takes care of most of the waves where invaders are unable to fire bullets fast enough to reach you. in Laser/Dart missions, this requires insane reflexes and lightning fast swiping to where you need to be.
- Generally, since darts move too fast, it is too difficult to use MBc between wave transitions. MB is usually deployed either all the way at the bottom.
- The deployment is based on how the tracking dart turrets are laid out in a wave. Just so long you aren’t in point blank range of dart tracking turrets, it should be possible to pull off MBs with the right positioning.
- In community and specialist missions, VLs clean up the rest which would be Herons and Eagles. Unload it on a Vulture to pop off turrets if you overfill.
- In daily missions, VL is used a lot. It will be used in heavy waves where you unload a full barrel of 3 or 4 VLs to exterminate the whole field, particularly when 3 VLs vaporize Eagles. It is also used in medium waves where 2 VLs is generally sufficient to destroy most of the wave, and then the main finishes the job. As the main goes off, you should then be charging MB for the next wave.
- MB should be used in light waves since it gets very annoying to chase down all the Ravens and Sparrows, and a VL sweep may not do enough to destroy everything due to their rapid movement.
- Despite the armor damage reduction, in daily missions, Wraith will still absolutely dominate. This is because there are not many contender ships with a double form of AoE damage. The closest is Saber, but REMP is not as damaging as MB. The supposed fastest in Armored missions, EX04239, does not possess any form of AoE damage, and thus lacks speed in daily missions.
- The double AoE damage is so powerful in daily missions, it can sometimes even exceed Exarch in Shielded missions.
- However, because an MB will not decimate Armored or Shielded Ravens, you will need to sweep with your main to take them out. The sweeping process is similar to how you would do it in early waves.
- When a wave is cleared, quickly reposition yourself for the next wave and release your touch to reset the main burst. If you are not intending to use MB, then when the next wave fully arrives, engage touch to immediately set off the next burst.

## Fun

- With double forms of AoE damage, Wraith is frighteningly fast. Its MB and VL leave no mercy for its victims. Expect the field to be flooded with particles quickly, especially in daily missions.
- Wraith has a very annoying main to optimize since it’s both very thin and bursty.

## Trivia

- Wraith was only introduced into Phoenix 2 at v3.0.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_65_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Extended Range
- Type: Zen
- Description: More potent energy particles increase the blast range.
- Interpretation: The max radius increases from 400 to 500.
- Form: Lambda
- Price: 30000
- Score: 3.18 / 5

For Wraith, the point of this APEX is that you can charge bombs at the bottom of the screen. It's not easy to clear certain waves of attacks using only main and Vorpal Lances, for example, if there are many sparrows or ravens. In this case, you can choose to charge the MB at the bottom, and then use the Lance riding to avoid the bullets.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_65_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: High Capacity
- Type: Aura
- Description: Vorpal Lance can store more energy, adding an additional Counter.
- Interpretation: The max volume increases from 4 to 5.
- Form: Gamma
- Price: 15000
- Score: 2.82 / 5

This skin is equivalent to better than nothing, because Wraith's speedrun ability is already very strong, and in many cases a Mega Bomb with an expanded range is not needed. Why not try the high-capacity APEX at this time? You never know when you will need it.
