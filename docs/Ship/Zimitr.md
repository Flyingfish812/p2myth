## Survival

- A very balanced ship with both Aura and Zen processing both an offensive and defensive aspect, Zimitr is able to wipe out invader fairly quickly and also have the capability to survive well enough.
- Under normal circumstances, using an SEMP wipes off Sparrows cleanly. However in missions with MIRV Deathonators, using SEMP to wipe out all the Sparrows is a very bad idea since it'll leave an utter mess of pellets in all directions, making it very difficult to dodge the mess. Instead, reserve REMP for such waves. This covers up for SEMP's weakness in such situations with a heavy presence of MIRV Deathonators.
- Because Zimitr's main is weak, but it is SB, it is a good idea to try and strip the invaders of their shields first before releasing an REMP.
- Thus, you should aim to start off a wave with an SEMP, then go around and do as much as possible to strip invaders of their shields first, before using REMP.
- Unfortunately, the unpredictability of where the Arurus Satellites will hit make this very difficult, so just try your best to circle around the field to strip as much as you can. Particularly, focus on stripping the shields of Ravens such that the REMP fired later will completely destroy them to gain back enough particles for an additional full or near full SEMP.
- Don't release REMP at the very end of the stun duration, since you still need time to collect particles to fire off another SEMP. Only make a very quick roundabout around the invaders to let about one round of the main to go off and then release the REMP.
- If it's not possible to get enough particles for a sizeable SEMP, head to an upper corner of the field (if there aren't many dart tracking turrets) or to the bottom of the field immediately, and you'll have to work your way out of the bullet mess.

## Speedrun

- The double AoE forms of damage can make Zimitr quite fast.
- However, the weak main of Zimitr limits its maximum potential.
- As mentioned above, since the SEMP + REMP does not completely destroy Shielded Ravens and the random nature of the main means it may not target these weakened Ravens, regeneration of shields can get pretty common, which makes speedrunning sometimes pretty random based on the main.

## Fun

- The SEMP + REMP combo is very fun to pull off since they complement with each other due to the fact they each do not deal a lot of AoE damage, and their added AoE damage is almost just enough to destroy Ravens.
- However, it is ALMOST just enough to destroy Shielded Ravens, which means they still survive, and because it can be difficult to have the main target the many Ravens on screen, some of them often regenerate their shields which gets a little annoying.

## Trivia

- Zimitr was only introduced into Phoenix 2 at v5.0.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_90_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: High Damage
- Type: Aura
- Description: Increased distortion of the Stun EMP causes even more damage to Invaders.
- Interpretation: The max damage increases from 10 to 15.
- Form: Delta
- Price: 20000
- Score: 4.64 / 5

An extremely powerful apex, this apex completely eliminates the frustrating problem where Zimitr is unable to finish off Shielded Ravens after pulling off the SEMP + REMP combo as the increased SEMP damage + REMP completely obliterates Shielded Ravens, which makes Zimitr a lot more fun to play around with. No longer will you have to deal with the frustrating random nature of the main.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_90_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Extended Range
- Type: Zen
- Description: Improved amplifiers increase the EMP range.
- Interpretation: The max range increases from 225 to 280.
- Form: Epsilon
- Price: 25000
- Score: 3.00 / 5

A very useful apex for days with MIRV Deathonators, the increased REMP range destroys all the Sparrows very quickly and clears the troublesome MIRV Deathonators pellets. It also significantly improves Zimitrâ€™s defences, especially when it has the capability to clear out more darts. The increased REMP range also catches more invaders than normally possible, which is hindered by the density of waves, since there is a real chance of turret collision.
