## Survival

- No defense other than ML. Plus ML is no reliable defence, especially in Blight where they are fast bullets and lasers.
- Using a second LS to clear out the wave (if there are too many excess particles) is a great idea, and you can begin charging ML while LS does its job.
- Havoc's main is quite capable of popping turrets off, but it requires >1 bursts to do so, which can be troublesome.

## Speedrun

- Chaining LS after ML at the start of a wave works to take out either Vultures or one side of the invaders rather quickly.
- Unfortunately this means you need the right wave compositions, a heavily cluttered Raven crowd at the back even with a Vulture in front could spell trouble, especially when they are equipped with spread lasers. Also, a wave with most of the invaders in the middle also means trouble, as taking out the middle means leaving the sides alive, and you could be sandwiched between lasers or bullets.
- Optimizing the main burst becomes important, to try and hit Ravens and above. Sparrows will generally naturally be taken out by the blast damage.
- 2 MLs in a heavy wave may be possible, so always look out for such opportunities. However, the awkwardness of Havoc's main may make transiting to the other side difficult.
- Although Havoc's burst is short, take note it is possible to cut it off halfway, especially when charging ML. If you are using the main to finish off the last invaders of the wave, remember to exhaust the full burst before charging ML.
- In light waves, you can use LS to finish off the rest of the wave and charge ML early. Since LS still does take time to destroy the last of the invaders, ensure the burst completes before charging ML.

## Fun

- Going fast can indeed be quite fun, although Havoc isn't per say very fast.
- The main is pretty annoying to use, being bursty and very thin.
- Havoc's reactor position is very awkward being at the back of the ship, and the shape of Havoc is another massive hindering factor to piloting it.

## Trivia

- Nothing trivia :(

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_22_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Volatile Mass
- Type: Main Weapon
- Description: Mass Driver shots have a larger explosion.
- Interpretation: nan
- Form: Alpha
- Price: 5000
- Score: 3.27 / 5

This apex increases the blast radius of its Mass Driver projectiles.

A fun apex if you love Havoc, the increased blast radius more easily catches rapid moving Sparrows, eliminating them faster. It also helps in dense Raven waves where Ravens may be situated close to each other, dealing more blast damage. This makes Havoc more viable for daily missions, particularly in denser waves since Havoc does not have another form of AoE damage aside from its main.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_22_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Tac Moons
- Type: Aura
- Description: Two Tactical Super Moons concentrate their firepower to dispose individual targets more quickly.
- Interpretation: 2 Laser Moons with stronger power will focus on invaders concentrately.
- Form: Gamma
- Price: 15000
- Score: 1.91 / 5

The concentrated LS allows Havoc to quickly deal against larger invaders, popping off their dangerous turrets quickly before bullets can flood the screen. The effect is only mostly noticeable on Vultures and above. This allows you to get off one burst of the Mass Driver on a Vultureâ€™s turret before you can move on to the next one as Tac Moons will finish off the job quickly.
