## Comments

- 圆锥曲线: I suggest uninstall its main weapon and add another laser system.
- Niu: It's the only ship with an exclusive badge, just say it's awesome or not.

## Survival

- No defense. Kappa allows you to dodge through tight gaps where needed, but there's absolutely no way to clear them.
- Most of the time, Ogon spends its time camping at the upper half of the screen, avoiding all the laser fire, and desperately hoping no invader comes crashing into it by turret collision.
- Absolutely horrid main. It tracks so slowly most of the DPS is leaked switching targets. Considering the fact it is already the lowest DPS in the game, the slow tracking makes it wayyyyyyyy worse.
- Not to mention, the main has a horrible habit of switching targets after aiming at one after a short while, making the main all the more leaky. This also means that it is horrible at turret popping. LS is a slight saving grace but as you know, LS also has a habit of switching targets fast which also makes turret popping difficult.
- Despite the horrendous defensive capabilities and slow killing, it still does manage to kill fast enough to make sure lasers don't have enough time to turn all the way behind to aim at it. But beware of the heaviest and densest wave the game throws at you, because those waves are the true killer where lasers actually have enough time to aim at you. Or if you are faced with a Roc with tracking lasers...say goodbye to your clear.
- However, in Pellet/Shuriken/Laser missions, while it is still possible to achieve a clear, you are going to have to lead the shuriken launchers on a round robin trip so they never have the chance to target you. Be careful of spread lasers, and because lasers don't track as fast, some lasers may even turn around and aim at you quicker than you expect.
- On the other hand, using it in community or specialist missions where bullets are abundant, good luck Kappa dodging your way out of it all.

## Speedrun

- A completely horrid main is enough to justify its incapability to speedrun.
- The LS does help in clearing invaders out a little faster, but LS is generally lackluster in its slow damage. Also Kappa does help to refill LS quite fast.
- Unfortunately, the LS + Kappa combo works very badly together. The long duration of LS means you have no idea how much Kappa to use, and overusing it means a wastage of particles which severely affects your speed.
- Ogon's main weapon aims at the invader's turret using angles, which can be likened to the polar coordinate system, commonly seen in radar charts. So, to swiftly eliminate all invaders, it's crucial to ensure that all invaders are on the same side of the your ship as much as possible. Since the vertical distance between the various turrets on the same invader is smaller than the horizontal distance, positioning the Ogon to the side of the invader formation can reduce damage loss caused by switching targets for the main weapon. This tactic is applicable in pure laser-based missions, while in other types of levels, it's best to dodge bullets diligently.
- When using the base Ogon and the Beta APEX, it's important to ensure that the main weapon doesn't scatter before entering the next wave, as concentrating the main weapon fire can effectively focus fire.

## Fun

- LS is pretty fun to watch in action for sure.
- The photon array, while completely stupid, is a great spectacle to watch when maxed, which is really the main saving grace for its fun factor. Because of its horrible habit of switching targets ever so often, it really looks like a (green) light show.
- Equally distributed damage to every invader.
- Using Kappa Drive to generate aura, and activate your main weapon from time to time.
- Using Ogon to finish a mission will make you happy for a long while.

## Trivia

- Due to its horrid main and thus absolutely horrible effective DPS, Ogon has become probably the biggest meme in the game. Players would often tease that Ogon is the best ship, but you know otherwise after reading this. ;) It is common to use Ogon as a verb/subject to mean something troll on Phoenix 2 online platforms.
- There is specifically a badge for Ogon called “Ogon Is Fine”. This badge is obtained by clearing a Marshal S4 Daily Mission with Ogon (upgrade level and with or without apex does not matter) and having that score stay on the leaderboard for the entirety of the mission. The badge was added in v4.5.
- One round of main weapon is enough for one armored raven.
- Ogon is one of the 7 ships that doesn’t use thrusters to fly in Phoenix 2. Ogon looks like some kind of ship kept afloat by its large balloon-like body.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_27_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Tac Moons
- Type: Aura
- Description: Two Tactical Super Moons concentrate their firepower to dispose individual targets more quickly.
- Interpretation: 2 Laser Moons with stronger power will focus on invaders concentrately.
- Form: Beta
- Price: 10000
- Score: 1.91 / 5

For missions where you need to pop turrets, this APEX may be of some use, because it allows you to focus fire on a very threatening turret. Although these concentrated fires are often a drop in the bucket, it's better than nothing, right?

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_27_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Photon Array MK3
- Type: Main Weapon
- Description: Greatly improved target tracking speed.
- Interpretation: nan
- Form: Phi
- Price: 45000
- Score: 3.45 / 5

This apex massively improves Ogon's tracking speed to Very Fast. It is no doubt an extremely huge buff to Ogon and you no longer have to worry about a wonky main that is so difficult to land, and thus, will be able to kill much faster. It is also less frustrating to use as you can now be anywhere you want on the field to dodge incoming fire without worrying about not doing any damage at all as the main struggles to keep up. However, despite the extreme buff to Ogon, the abysmal DPS coupled with a horrible Aura Zen combination, still make Ogon a weak ship that is still difficult to use in the higher leagues. There is simply not enough justification for you to spend so much credits just to buy an apex that doesn't help you very much in the higher leagues. For the meme, however, you can justify that. Or if you somehow like Ogon so much for its light shows, which is sort of still awesome with the lasers constantly scattering about (although in my opinion, the original slow re-targeting looks more awesome, this target switching is too abrupt and fast).
