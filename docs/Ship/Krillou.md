## Survival

- SEMP allows you to have breathing space to navigate around to kill Ravens fast and refill your Aura again. The stun duration is also great for popping off dangerous turrets such as spinners and MIRV Bloomers.
- If possible, always charge MB after the last shot clears the previous wave to set up for the next wave. Krillou's projectiles travel slowly which allow you to have time to charge MB as the shot travels.
- The last invader being destroyed should ideally be a large invader, Eagle or above. This allows you to be sure the last projectile hits and you can charge MB.
- If it's not possible to pull MB off in the next wave, immediately use a SEMP, find a safe spot and resume charging MB (if they are sufficient Ravens around).

## Speedrun

- 2 shots of the main kill a Raven. This means you should switch targets when you know that 2 shots are going to land. It can be hard due to Raven random movement, but you should be getting up very close to them to ensure your 2 shots hit.
- The SEMP + MB combination is insanely powerful. This combination has the capability to kill Ravens instantly despite the armor damage reduction (which many AP ships with MB struggle with) This means you only really need to focus on larger invaders, Eagles and above generally.
- Optimizing the main to hit each photon bomb properly is not extremely difficult (but is still very difficult, just not impossibly so) as they fire at sufficiently slow intervals and have a pretty wide hit circle so missing a shot when piloted properly is quite rare.
- MB positioning is extremely important: The Fusion Core of MB should generally hit multiple Herons or Eagles, or a Vulture if there are no Eagles and Herons around. This allows Eagles and Herons to be taken out quicker where particles are scarce. In order to go extremely fast, you have to position yourself out in the open and charge MB, which exposes you to a lot of danger, particularly from invader random movement.
- Due to the need to take out turrets or Ravens very quickly, you must be able to switch targets extremely fast. This means that you will often go point blank with invaders, which is very possible due to SEMP.
- Speedrunning with Krillou is different from simply surviving, as there is nearly no way you are going to charge MB at the start of every wave. Instead, you will be first firing SEMP, and then finding an appropriate spot to charge MB at.
- This is because when speedrunning, due to how fast Krillou is, you'll almost never have any bullets on field. Thus, you should aim to go in extreme close combat with invaders to take them out. The slow moving projectiles of Krillou also mean standing back to aim at invaders will be too slow. This means you will always end off any wave with yourself being positioned upfield, leaving you at point blank range with the next wave of invaders, which makes you certain to die if you charge MB first.

## Fun

- To wipe out Ravens instantly with SEMP + MB is definitely one of the most satisfying things to do, wiping all Ravens on the playing field immediately, which is something that is pretty unique to Krillou since no other AP ships have this Aura Zen combination.
- Even though the main is an alternating left-right, the interval between each shot from each side is quite fast and is less of an issue. The photon bombs also have a rather large hit circle so it's not too bad.
- Even though the main does splash damage, it is usually quite negligible as you need 2 indirect blast damage to wipe out sparrows.
- Very awkward reactor position.

## Trivia

- Although it is hard to believe, this ship performed quite well in the MIRV Spam mission.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_5_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Compressed Blast
- Type: Zen
- Description: Energy compression mixes Fusion Core and regular blast into a singular heavy explosion.
- Interpretation: The damage increases from 30 to 70, the radius decreases from 400 to 200.
- Form: Gamma
- Price: 15000
- Score: 2.73 / 5

The extreme density of invaders in daily mission make this apex extremely powerful, obliterating Herons and Eagles very quickly. It is so fast, yet sufficiently defensive that it will conquer the harder daily missions and get you the BoB.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_5_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: EMP Core
- Type: Zen
- Description: Fusion Core also destroys enemy bullets.
- Interpretation: The bullets within a range of 100 will be cleared.
- Form: Alpha
- Price: 5000
- Score: 1.73 / 5

The need for Krillou to charge upfield means this apex can be slightly beneficial to preventing unnecessary stupid deaths resulting from stray bullets being fired during the initial wave (which is hard to prevent) or bullets from previous waves. Other than the slight boost from being a bit easier, this apex is honestly not much a help.
