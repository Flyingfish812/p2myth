## Survival

- No defence other than ML which can clear bullets between waves.

## Speedrun

- Fujin is a very awkward ship. The thin main means that it is hard to optimize, especially when switching targets after one invader is destroyed. You will spill a lot of DPS.
- The other problem with Fujin is that it is not powerful enough to wipe a wave clean without it being flooded by darts from dart spreads.
- The darts being showered onto you means it can be very difficult to navigate your way around the field due to its thin main spread (which is only straight firing).
- This means you need to be strategic about eliminating invaders. Start off each wave on one side if you can. Kill off that side of invaders and then attempt to move to the other side to take out the rest.
- The transition of sides is very awkward due it being blocked off by dart streams. Sometimes you have to circle around from the upfield which means leaking DPS from the main.
- This attracts all darts to one side and when that side is gone, you should be able to take out the rest of the wave quickly enough so that darts do not flood the field.
- It is possible to start from the middle but you are going to suffer trying to dodge your way around holes inbetween dart streams. I won't recommend it much unless you are confident of dodging fast.
- The ML then LS combo vaporizes frontline Vultures pretty fast, in about less than 2 seconds (after the ML has fired)
- Unfortunately, LS is lackluster as the damage from LS is dealt slowly. The primary purpose of LS to disarm invaders is just irrelevant for Fujin. LS every wave where possible.
- A great technique to go faster reliably is to use a second LS at the end of a wave. Use this when the invader numbers have dwindled to a few remaining Ravens and Sparrows. While the second LS is ongoing, start charging LS by positioning yourself midfield. This allows LS to reliably eliminate the rest of the invaders, while making sure ML is ready before the next wave arrives. This technique is particularly useful in daily missions since particles are abundant. Just make sure you have destroyed all the dart tracking turrets first.
- When the field is a bit more clear of bullets (usually when only the Vulture is left), you can now start using the main to pop off high tier dart tracking turrets. Usually it shouldn't be necessary to pop off dart spinners because you either will struggle to hit it when it's active, or it's in cooldown state and you can kill the whole Vulture before it starts up again.

## Fun

- Do you like lasers? Because Fujin has all kinds of lasers, from small ones (LS) to medium ones (main) to big ones (ML).
- Killing invaders fast is pretty fun. Also, almost instantly vaporizing a frontline Vulture is definitely very satisfying.
- The punchy sounds of the main is pretty satisfying.
- The ship design makes the reactor seem very awkward, and can be difficult to judge.

## Trivia

- Fujin used to be the app icon of Phoenix 2 before v3.0. The app icon has a different skin of Fujin which was never used, even now with apexes being released.
- The old app icon with Fujin was used as a small advertisement icon in the predecessor game, Phoenix HD, for quite a long time before it was recently updated to properly reflect the new icon. In other words, there was a period of time when the Phoenix 2 actual app icon (in your Home screen) was different from the icon in Phoenix HD.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_7_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Double Shot
- Type: Zen
- Description: Two separate energy releases create two beams in quick succession.
- Interpretation: Two 100-damage lasers will be fired one by one, with a one-second interval.
- Form: Epsilon
- Price: 25000
- Score: 3.00 / 5

This apex is useful for a beginner Fujin speedrunner who wants to try out Fujin. Particularly, because of the thin and straight firing Quantum Beams, and ML being only focused on whatever is ahead, as well as LS being too weak to deal with invaders that are to the side of Fujin, this apex helps a lot in clearing out the front row invaders that would otherwise severely restrict your movement due to the fast moving bullets (darts and boomerangs) they fire. The main weapon is not fast enough to take them out quickly enough, thus splitting ML into 2 columns would help Fujin give clearance space to the bottom of the field so that you can survive more easily. The better manuveurability of Fujin also means less end wave problems where you have to change to the other side of the field to finish the last surviving invaders off.

In addition, it can also be used to pop off 2 turrets off a Vulture, which helps in manuveurability, although this is usually difficult to pull off. It is a bonus if you do pull it off however. Eagles also go down after one ML and just a few more shots from the main weapon. Thus, whatever directly in front of Fujin is bound to get mostly vaporized very quickly.

However, given that an apex can generally only be accessed after a long time you have first gotten a ship, there is not much point in getting this apex since you would likely be already very familiar with Fujin, unless you just want to enjoy Fujin a bit more easily, especially when days get crowded.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_7_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: High Power
- Type: Aura
- Description: A constellation of Laser Moons outputs all damage in less time.
- Interpretation: The laser moons increases from 5 to 8, the max duration decreases from 4.5s to 2.25s.
- Form: Sigma
- Price: 35000
- Score: 3.36 / 5

A very powerful apex, the increase in firepower provided by High Power LS allows Fujin to obliterate invaders at frightening speeds. The abundance of particles also mean many LS continue to be launched at full Aura size, effectively doubling the DPS provided by LS. The quick action of LS to strip invaders of turrets makes Fujin powerful against larger invaders, including Rocs where you could see that the Roc quickly had its turrets stripped.
