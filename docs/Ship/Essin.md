## Survival

- You will be surprised, but PS works very well on Essin. Not only can PS be quite abusable (about once every wave, or sometimes if the wave lasts long enough, twice), shielding yourself from bullets and lasers alike, but launching LS before using PS is extremely useful. You can stay safe and let LS and PS Laser Reflect do the work, and then possibly wait for some of the invaders to be killed before making your next move.
- With the Phase Out of PS, you can clear a bit of bullets on your way out, which is useful for hopping bullet lanes.
- The main is quite powerful as it is a continuous stream which means you don't really leak much DPS except when switching targets. It is somewhat inconsistent though, as the spread does throw off accuracy quite a bit.
- The somewhat inaccurate main does also mean that it is hard to pop turrets off, which is quite an issue.
- Unfortunately, as Essin only has PS as its defence, it has very limited defence against bullets, which can become an issue in bullet heavier Laser/Pellet missions.

## Speedrun

- Essin is definitely one of the most consistent ships around, due to it always dealing damage, even while shielded in its own PS, since it would be using LS to deal damage in the shielded time. The constant stream of the main also means consistency.
- Essin has a perfect main for its SB type. Simply sweep the field with your main so that most of the frontline invaders have their shields stripped (for smaller invaders such as Herons or Ravens) before you launch LS and PS into action so that you take advantage of the SB main. With frontline Vultures or Eagles, their shields go down pretty fast too for you to launch LS into action.
- For dense waves, it can be quite frustrating since invader movements can make the cyclone cannon miss some of the front row invaders and not strip the shields completely. In that aspect, speedrunning can get a bit random.
- In initial Acts of community and specialist missions, because of the random scattering nature of the main, you have to inch slowly to make sure you cover the field, otherwise the main may not be able to finish off Sparrows very well.

## Fun

- Essin's main is a spectacle to watch, watching actual shurikens (and not those boring red shurikens from invaders) being thrown at invaders. And yeah, not to mention LS is also a spectacle to watch as well.
- Essin's reactor is a little more forward than usual, making it a little strange, but still quite manageable since the reactor isn't obstructed by the ship details.

## Trivia

- Not have any trivia.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_33_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Improved Optics
- Type: Main Weapon
- Description: Cyclones have better homing capabilities.
- Interpretation: nan
- Form: Alpha
- Price: 5000
- Score: 2.00 / 5

This apex improves the homing capabilities of its cyclone cannon.

This apex is a great joy to use, as you no longer have to worry about Essin’s erratic shurikens going everywhere and not hitting their target. A very good apex especially against tracking laser turrets since the improved homing allows you to still be able to hit the Eagle whose side turrets are tracking lasers. It also allows you to switch targets more effectively, especially when you have to rapidly strafe to the other side.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_33_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Super Reflect
- Type: Zen
- Description: Split-second shield activation just before laser firing will reflect back with extra force.
- Interpretation: The lasers hitting the shield at the first 0.5s will be reflected back with 5x damage.
- Form: Gamma
- Price: 15000
- Score: 4.18 / 5

A very powerful apex against larger invaders, quickly decimating them before they pump out too many bullets to overwhelm Essin’s limited defence capabilities. The timing of the Super Reflect can be easily caught so long you remember to use LS only just before using PS for Super Reflect, otherwise the LS sounds will mask the invader laser firing sounds and make it hard to estimate the timing.
