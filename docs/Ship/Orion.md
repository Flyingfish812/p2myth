## Comments

- 圆锥曲线: Behave with courtesy towards Delta Orion, and you can enjoy a lazy life.

## Survival

- Orion is probably one of the easiest defensive ships to use.
- In MIRV/Shuriken missions, a very common technique is to camp at the top corner of the screen and nothing will hit since spinners are rare. However, it is generally a lazy strategy, and may not always work as you eat particles very quickly, which may be essentially in later waves. Be careful of Vultures since they may contain DDMBs. Also be careful of mass Ravens that may fill up to the corner of the screen which may cause turret collision.
- PD will take care of the first wave of MIRVs fired by Ravens and Herons. In subsequent MIRV waves, if backed up by shurikens, TP right into the shuriken clouds with the biggest MIRV cluster, and then use PD to clear out a bit more space around you, as well as to get rid of the other pellets released by the MIRVs that exploded around you.
- Follow with the speed of the shuriken cloud as it exits the screen. When you are being cornered, you can then teleport to the opposite end of the field. This will make shuriken launchers confused. Just be careful of any DDMBs or Ravens that might be populating that side.
- In a Roc battle, camping at a top corner is very useful, if the Roc is not equipped with any pellet or shuriken spinners or DDMBs. MIRV Bloomers are of no issue as PD takes care of them very quickly. Just shift or TP over to the other top corner when the shuriken launchers slowly turn their way towards you.
- In other missions, TP is your primary means of escape. Use it to get you out of tight spots where you can no longer dodge. It needs some anticipation because you cannot TP instantly after you release your hold on the screen. Release as early as you feel threatened.
- Next step is to find a new spot to TP to. Look out for a spot with less bullets around. Time slows when you are ready to TP so you have a tiny bit of time (which is why release early if possible when you see an impenetrable wall of bullets) to decide.
- Once you’ve decided the best spot to go to, TP there. If it’s still pretty crowded, start using PD to clear some space to dodge. Otherwise just dodge while you can. Generally you would stay there for quite some time since it’s the least bullet heavy spot, but over some time it’ll get crowded again, so repeat the cycle.
- Remember that TP is quite abusable as it recharges very fast, so don’t be afraid to use it, but try not to double TP (consecutive TPs), let it cool for a second or 2 before going again if needed.
- Be careful not to overspend PD, don't hold down PD but use it in taps so that you can dodge a bit before necessitating another tap of the PD.

## Speedrun

- There's no way you are speedrunning with a perfect aiming main and completely defensive abilities.
- The only way to optimize it is to use TP to pace the main such that the main fires just as the next wave start to arrive.
- Or simply remove the Teleport so that you can control your main more freely.

## Fun

- Orion is extremely boring because there is nothing else to do other than to move around a bit and dodge, and PD and TP when you are threatened.
- PD is kind of satisfying to hear and the impact of Orion's photon scatter is not bad, but the playstyle of the ship is so boring, it just doesn't deserve to be played after you are clearing a mission with it. Orion works but it's just so boring to play. You are literally just sitting around waiting for bullets to come and get you.
- In current version, it's fun to watch a firework show in MIRV Spam mission by staying at the top left corner. Especially when there are huge amounts of MIRVs on the screen and you TP into them ... Ah~♥
- You can pop a turret painlessly thanks to the fact that the position of the core and the main weapon are different, just put the turret in that hole.

## Trivia

- Orion was only introduced into Phoenix 2 at v2.2.

## APEX 1

<img src="/ships/ship_56_apex_1.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: EMP Laser
- Type: Aura
- Description: Destroyed bullets trigger a small Bullet EMP.
- Interpretation: Laser Beams decreased from 10 to 1, but a Bullet EMP of range 50 will be activated each time.
- Form: Delta
- Price: 20000
- Score: 3.45 / 5

This apex. Is. Just. Lazy Mode. You can practically sit in one bottom corner of the field the entire game and just tap your PD when you see a bullet that is seemingly headed your way, whether is it even going to actually hit you or just pass by your side. You can even go and drink a coffee, play with one eye closed, play with your brain being in a total blur, or whatever. Here's your free ticket to 400¢ everyday (after you've spent the 20,000¢ of course). You're welcome.

## APEX 2

<img src="/ships/ship_56_apex_2.png" style={{zoom:1}}/>

- Name: Extended Clearance
- Type: Zen
- Description: Energy from the Teleport is released on arrival to extended the range of the Arrival EMP.
- Interpretation: The clearing space increases from 50 to 80.
- Form: Lambda
- Price: 30000
- Score: 1.55 / 5

A rather useful apex especially against the massive spread and flood of shurikens everywhere in MIRV/Shuriken missions, this apex allows you to have more breathing room when teleporting into a mess of shurikens, in order to avoid some pellets released from a few MIRV detonations. It will also eliminate more MIRVs on arrival, especially when forward firing MIRVs are in dozens and can be quite spread out at times. That being said, it is inferior to the Delta Apex which basically turns such missions into a total cakewalk.
