# Cyber Matcher

(It will be good if it can be implemented, but it is a problem to deal with online delay processing. I guess)

- Basic rule: Matching with the same rarity.

## Banshee & Luna

Reason: The defense of Banshee is not enough, and the output of luna is just normal, the two are combined perfectly. Banshee's Goliath missile explosion and Luna's main weapon sweep to harvest the remainings, also with the teleport to clear the bullet and save your life. It's GREAT.

## Fujin & Aurora

Reason: Fujin's output is enough, its survival depends on the player's skill, and there is no AOE damage, Aurora's main weapon is exactly what you need to fill in this gap, and the teleport + strong bullet clear can save your life after Fujin's graze. Aurora = goddess of light, the goddess of light + the god od wind can directly give the invaders a great burial.

## Reaper & Cinnri

Reason: Cinnri has a normal output and its survival depends on the player's skill too. The best situation to achieve the maximum output is to stand in the middle of the invaders, so Cinnri's Stun EMP is very useful at this time, and the Mega Laser can also be very powerful against the heavy wave formation or the Condor and the Roc.

## Elyon & Tempest

Reason: The main weapon of the storm is very annoying, and the Mega Laser sometimes misses the target. I don't know if it's because the invaders' positioning is not so random. Anyway, it's very annoying and I want to eat it. It just so happens that Elyon can deal with the small scums like sparrows, ravens and herons very quickly. The laser storm is very good-looking, but the output is not enough and the survivability depends on the player's skill. The tempest can make up for it and save the life; This combination has no AOE damage. I don't know if it can pass the formation in version 5.0. However, both of them are common ships, which should correspond to low-value consumables in the P2 world (?)

## Lyova & Corsair

Reason: When facing vultures, condors and rocs, Lyova is like scratching the invaders, but its survivability is very high; the output of Corsair is enough, and its survivability also depends on the player's skill. In addition, the playing of Corsair's main weapon is too bad compared with that in Phoenix HD. It may be that the acceleration of the rocket is too small and it flies softly, making it very torturous to catch a single sparrow. Lyova has noble AOE damage at this time, which is great, and it can also save Corsair's life after he has grazed all the bullets.

## Disaris & Nimbus

Reason: When facing a formation without vultures, condors and rocs, Nimbus relies on AOE damage to do the main output, while Disaris is responsible for finishing off the invaders and looking for opportunities with the aura. If there are condors and rocs with a lot of bullets, Disaris will go up and kill it directly. If there are not too many bullets, he will slowly fire the two main weapons together like Fujin. It can be said that this combination is the closest to a perfect combination and can cope with all types of missions.

## Phoenix & Jeria

If nothing unexpected happens, Jeria should be an extremely crazy guy who can easily get himself into trouble, so he needs a steady ship like Phoenix to balance the life-saving measures, and use the Personal Shield to reflect the lasers when they are too dense to kill all the invaders.

## Lorilou & EX04239

Reason: EX04239 needs to flexibly clear bullets in a small range to open up more space for movement, and the Phalanx of Lorilou is useful at this time. When facing a formation of two columns of invaders, two ships can release the Mega Laser at the same time to quickly pass through, so it can be said that Lorilou is an auxiliary plugin for EX04239 (?)

## Yigothu & Mirage

Reason: The damage of Night Fury is just enough to kill a Shielded Condor that has lost its shield, which is good. But the main weapon is not so good, and the CD of Night Fury is too long and cannot be used frequently. You are cool in this wave, but if you face a group of ravens and herons in the next wave, you can only use the main weapon to scratch slowly. Yigothu has noble AOE Zen and even has a bullet-clearing function. And Yigothu also has a scratching main weapon facing the Condor and the Roc, so Mirage's Night Fury laser comes in handy. The two complement each other's shortcomings.
