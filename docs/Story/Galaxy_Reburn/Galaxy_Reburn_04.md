# Chapter 4: Ablaze

> Written by: 菁鸟

### 1

The voice coming from the medal was a bit muffled, but incredibly reassuring - it was like a lifeline. 

Disar cradled the medal, still not recovered from the pain, and did not respond at first.

The sound of the escape pod departing came from the end of the corridor.

"Cadet? Do you copy?"

"Y-Yes!" 

Phoenix quickly pushed off the wall, flying over to Disar's side in the zero gravity, responding.

"Report the battle situation immediately."

Phoenix immediately looked out the window, seeing several ships from the Void Fleet streaking by, their engine trails leaving arcing lines.

"Actually—"

Disar wanted to explain that they were not recruits, but just two student passengers who were attacked, but was immediately cut off by Phoenix's voice.

"The passenger ship is under attack. Limited side view shows one Heron, four Ravens, approximately ten Sparrows equipped with Caged MIRV, Laser and Speed Laser turrets visible. More keep appearing."

Disar looked at Phoenix, surprised she could rattle off those terms, but she wasn't surprised Phoenix could say those terms.

They're really going to treat us like soldiers—Phoenix! Disar silently called out.

"Received. Your coordinates are confirmed. The nearest Alliance troops are en route. What's the status of your defensive systems?"

Phoenix started to turn her head, but Disar answered first: "Number Dovacoon 194. Those shields are completely destroyed. Auto-cannons completely damaged, one auto-machinegun moderately damaged and one lightly damaged."

The two made eye contact. 

Disar saw the determination in Phoenix's eyes, and Phoenix saw the same in hers.

"Ship status visible. Now immediately proceed to the lightly damaged machinegun and activate manual control. Attack the enemy forces as best you can to keep them away from the escape pods. Move fifteen meters towards the front of the ship from your current position and open the starboard emergency hatch to access the gun deck. Long transmissions risk detection, going offline."

What Disar feared most had come to pass.

Indeed, they were not soldiers of the Galactic Alliance Army, merely a pair of teenagers.

Attacking the enemy meant they would be attacked in turn, and the slightest mistake could get them killed on the spot.

Soldiers could die on the battlefield. But the two of them, having not clarified their identities, were naturally treated as such.

Phoenix looked at the medal in her hand, then out at the lasers streaking past the window.

"Received."

Disar knew Phoenix would say that.

Phoenix wanted to be a hero, and so did she herself.

Disar grabbed Phoenix's wrist, their hands trembling from facing death steadying considerably.  

"Let’s do this together."

The two hurried through the deafeningly loud alarm-blaring corridor, stepping over debris everywhere. Red and purple lasers flashed by outside, along with the explosions of micro fighters being concentrated fire from the auto-machineguns.

"Phoenix, here!"

Disar was the first to spot a flashing red light at the right corner of the corridor junction.

"Move these crates!"

They immediately cleared away the surrounding luggage, revealing a closed tubular hatch with "Auto-Machinegun Control Room" written in large letters.

Phoenix grabbed the handle without hesitation, trying to yank the hatch open, but didn't seem to have quite enough strength.

"Why is it so tight—"

"Boom—"

Just as Disar was about to lend a hand, another engine explosion rocked the ship, the powerful shockwave causing it to suddenly tilt. The two fell backwards, Phoenix pulling the hatch open in the process.

Once the ship stabilized, Disar peeked inside to see a vertical iron ladder descending downwards. The passage was too narrow, and pitch black—the lighting damaged in the collision, so the bottom of the ladder was invisible.

"I'll go down and scout ahead."

Phoenix hung the now-silent medal on her chest, grabbing onto the ladder handles and descending rung by rung.

"Be careful."

In the narrow passage, the sound of her shoes clanging on each rung echoed. Clang, clang, clang.

When Phoenix felt she had stepped onto a different surface, she realized there was a spherical glass wall behind her, showing the void of space, stars, the ruined warp gate, and the dancing enemy ships.

This was the control room.

The spherical cabin was rather cramped. Aside from the lone seat, it didn't seem like there was room for a second adult—but enough space remained for another child to stand. Phoenix could clearly see the gun barrels and turrets outside the cabin, pointing into the depths of space.

A hologram flickered with the words "Automated System Damaged". The numerous controls and buttons made her head spin a bit, but identifying some of their functions was still child's play for a military buff like her.

Finding the manual control button, Phoenix didn't hesitate to press it.

"Manual system activated. Shields online, weapons linked. Push lever to enter combat mode."

The hologram text immediately updated, a crosshair appearing. A mechanical prompt sounded from a nearby speaker.  

Phoenix ran back up the ladder, loudly calling for Disar, who soon joined her in the cabin.

Phoenix sat in the lone seat, while Disar crouched down, grabbing the back of the chair.

"I'm going to push the lever, ready?"

"We're only 13! Isn't it too early for us to be fighting and killing?"

"So what?  Are you scared?"

"Definitely not!"

Phoenix smiled, shoving the lever on her left all the way forward.

Boom—

At the bottom of the massive ship, a heavy machinegun turret was slowly powering up. The spherical turret and cabin slid out along a track on top, accompanied by clanking sounds as it locked into an unobstructed firing position.

Two Sparrows seemed to notice the sounds from the turret, turning to aim their cannons at the two girls.

Inside, Phoenix's hands were already on the controls.

"Twin machineguns loaded, 300 rounds remaining!" Disar loudly relayed the numbers on the screen.

Phoenix's eyes were locked on the screen, lining up the crosshairs with the enemy craft.

"It feels just like the shooting games we played at the arcade," Disar patted Phoenix's shoulder.

"Then I can't wait!" 

Phoenix stared intently at the enemy ships weaving through space.

"Get ready—"

"Fire!"

"Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat—"

Phoenix mercilessly held down the firing key, the gun barrel immediately unleashing a torrent of blue tracer rounds. The terrifying recoil seemed to push the entire control room backwards, the overhead mounting constantly clanking and scraping.

Sparrows moved swiftly, returning fire with their own bullets. The rounds impacted the shields just meters in front of the two girls, the explosions shaking the entire cabin and causing Disar's ears to ring.

"Bang!"

A fireball blossomed in space - Phoenix had scored a hit on one of the small enemy craft's turrets. That Void ship immediately caught fire, only its starboard laser turret still charging up.

"Warning, enemy laser charging detected, brace for impact."

An electronic voice sounded in the cabin. Disar reacted quickly, tucking herself fully behind Phoenix's chair. Phoenix didn't stop firing for a second.

The red laser beam struck the shields almost instantly, causing them to emit a piercing screech that seemed to tear at their eardrums.

Phoenix grit her teeth.

"Shield damage at 19%, estimated recharge time 124 seconds."

The enemy craft charged up again.

"Switch turrets, Disar! We have to take it down before the second salvo!" Phoenix yelled instinctively.

Disar immediately crawled out from behind, tapping the ammo button on the side hologram display.

"Ammo switched: Armor-piercing rounds, 20 remaining, loading."

"Got it." Phoenix immediately adjusted the control stick, re-aligning the turret.

"Loading complete. Ready to fire."

"Bang--!"

Even more powerful recoil slammed into them, Phoenix momentarily feeling weightless even strapped in. Disar gripped the overhead handrail tightly to avoid being thrown.

An deafening explosion!

The enemy craft instantly detonated into scattered debris drifting through the galaxy.

"Nice Shot!" Disar yelled from behind. "One more!"

Phoenix looked down at the radar - a small craft was approaching from the front left. She immediately swung the control stick, the cabin slowly rotating amidst mechanical grinding noises.

"Loading."

"This thing rotates so slowly!"

"Systems show 70% damage to the rotating track."

Disar reported.

"Oh rats, that's a huge weakness."

But they still had time. Even though it was cutting it close, by the time the enemy craft closed within firing range, the turret had fully rotated.

"Loaded."

Another powerful salvo followed, the small craft also blasted into fragments.

"Got it!"

"Loading."

Just as the two thought they had a moment to catch their breath, the radar suddenly blared a warning. Phoenix immediately looked to see a Heron  approaching from behind.

"Oh rats!"

Phoenix instantly worked the control stick, but the turret couldn't rotate the full 180 degrees in time.

Just as it rotated 90 degrees, the medium craft's bullets started pounding the shields.

The control room shook violently, Phoenix could barely keep the crosshairs steady, Disar using all her strength just to stay upright inside.

The turret's barrage was relentless, a constant stream of bullets enveloping the cabin.

"Warning, shield damage at 34%."

"Still can't get turned around!"

Just as the turret was about to rotate into an attacking angle, the enemy craft abruptly shifted position, circling back behind the gun barrel.

"Warning, shield damage at 48%." 

"We can't keep up with this thing's speed!"

Phoenix desperately worked the control stick, but the rotation was still too slow.

What seemed like a massive explosive round slammed into the main hull of the Dovacoon 194, causing the entire ship to shudder.

"Fwshhhh—"

A blinding flash filled their vision.

Opening their eyes again, the two noticed the attack had disappeared. 

The one on the radar also fell silent.

"Phoenix, look!"

Phoenix looked outside the cockpit.

It was a man, over 190 cm tall, whose attire reminded her of a planet in the Galactic Alliance — the Earth. 

This style of dress was called...a samurai?

The man was dressed in samurai garments, sheathing a long sword. On his rather antiquated brown shoulder guards was a symbol - the exclusive insignia of a "Major" in the Galactic Alliance Army.

"Phoenix, that's a Shipsian warrior!"

Phoenix also saw the unmistakable golden emblem.

The man floated silently in the starry void, as a small craft approached him at extreme speed, causing them to hold their breath.

He gripped the sword hilt, giving just a slight force to draw it out at a speed leaving afterimages, a crimson-purple flash appearing from within.

Draw, slash, sheathe. Flowing like clouds and water, completed in the blink of an eye.

The small enemy craft was torn to shreds by the sword beam in an instant, leaving only sparks. The explosion dissipated, the silent cosmos suddenly as if battle had never begun.

Disar pounded on the cockpit glass forcefully, trying to get the man's attention.

Obviously, the man noticed their presence. He moved his body up to their cockpit window, squinting inwards, then showing a somewhat surprised expression.

"Received external communication request from G.A.A.S. Shogun."

A line of text popped up on the holographic screen, and Disar quickly tapped to accept.

"Shogun connected. Was it you who sent the distress signal?"

The man spoke, his rather magnetic youthful voice playing through the speakers. This was the Shipsians' special ability - converting sound to electromagnetic waves - to enable communication in space.

"Yes."

Disar spoke into the mic.

"Wait. How old are you two?"  

"Thirteen."

"Well…Never mind."

Shogun seemed to have more to ask, but was interrupted by a small craft suddenly appearing. Without even turning his body, he just drew his sword, slashed twice, and sheathed it, reducing that ship to dust.

"Don't make any rash moves, do not open fire. Return to your ship and wait for us to clear out the enemy."  

"'Us'? Are there others?"

As Disar wondered, another prompt sounded.

"Received external communication request from G.A.A.S. Neni."

"Huh?" Phoenix tapped to accept.

Unlike the Shogun's voice, this new contact was female.

"Ah, Shogun - you're here too."

"Neni, get ready for battle. Snipe those Herons and Ravens near the hull. I'll clear out those Sparrows."

"Understood."

A flash of flames appeared behind the Shogun's back, then swiftly vanished from Phoenix's view. Replacing it was a woman who appeared around twenty years old. Beneath her green and purple hooded cloak, strands of silver hair peeked out, a pair of azure eyes looking towards them.

"They really are just kids." Neni muttered to herself, then suddenly realizing she hadn't greeted them, hurriedly said, "Oh, hi? I'm Neni, I -"

"- Watch out!"

The radar blared as Phoenix yelled into the mic. A small void fighter craft sped towards them, appearing dozens of meters behind Neni. Its white laser sights locked onto Neni as it began charging up.

"Lunar Advent."

Neni suddenly uttered something calmly, her hands clasped together. The metal rod-shaped devices on her arms disassembled in nearly a second, the components crawling up her arms towards her hands, converging in front of her chest, combining, extending.

Phoenix and Disar watched in awe as a massive sniper rifle formed in her hands within two seconds.

"Comet's Trail!"

Turn, load, aim, fire - the fluid motions completed in an instant. The enemy craft's laser had yet to fully charge when a green meteor struck it down.

"Those were lines from The Void: Anger of the Deity...?" 

Disar seemed to recognize those phrases, and they saw Neni's back tremble slightly.

"Oh my gosh...Finally..."

"Hm?"

"I've finally met a fellow fan!"

"Ah?"

Neni excitedly turned around, slamming her palms on the glass, her long sniper rifle casually slung over her shoulder.

"There's no one in the Galactic Alliance Army who likes anime and visual novels! Kid, what is your name..."

"...Neni, Herons guided artillery platform at 1 o'clock, 124 meters out, take it down."

The cold voice came over the speakers.

"R-Received, on it."

Neni showed a frightened look, gripping her rifle again and flying upwards, leaving the radar's detection range.

### 5

The two let out a breath of relief.

"He told us to return to the ship earlier, right?"

Disar looked at Phoenix.

"Then let's go back."

Phoenix pulled the control column, trying to move the turret and cockpit back.

The cockpit suddenly began violently shaking, halting all movement, followed by a piercing alarm.

"Warning, rail damage, movement stopped."  

"What’s going on?"

Phoenix pulled the column again, still violent shaking, nearly causing Disar to fall.

"Warning, rail damage, movement stopped."

"Damaged? What happened?"

Disar quickly looked outside at the rail, only then noticing it had been blasted apart quite far from the main ship during the earlier intense attack. 

"The rail is severed."

Phoenix heard the despair in Disar's voice and turned to look.

She bit her lip, thoughts racing, and reopened the mic to report to the two Ships warriors.

"Our rail is damaged. We can't return to the ship."

"Received, turret. We'll find a way to retrieve you after the battle ends." Shogun's voice came. "Stay put in silence to avoid enemy detection. Only call out if danger arises."

"Roger."

Phoenix closed her mic after hearing this.

"For now, let's just trust them, Disar."

More enemy craft flew by outside, followed by explosions as they were struck by Blade Storm. Trailing comet tails of the Vorpal Lance fell from the horizon - they had seen it in books, undoubtedly belonging to the warrior called Neni.

"So we just wait here?"

Disar looked at Phoenix.

"Yeah...I think so."

Phoenix didn't look at Disar, her gaze fixed on the stars.

Disar fell silent. From Phoenix's eyes, she saw longing, and a hint of...melancholy.

"Phoenix..."

Beep. Beep.

"Warning, detecting large enemy forces approaching..."

The shrill alarm blared again.

"Phoenix, look at the radar!"

Their expressions turned to horror.

### 6

Just like a cloud of red descended, nearly covering half the radar's range.

The comms sounded.

"Shogun, dead ahead!!!"

Neni's voice also carried surprise.

"Impossible. This place belongs to the interior."

The Shogun's tone also changed noticeably.

"I'll report to HQ!"

Neni sounded tense, her pitch rising.

Phoenix and Disar only heard Shogun grit his teeth as he said:

"- a Roc, with MIRV Bloomers, Pellet Spinner, and Doomsday Laser."
