### Alliance Year 47, October 2

Dear Phoenix,

Nice to hear from you!

I've just finished my exam, and I'm sitting at the communications office tapping on this clumsy terminal. Civilian interstellar mail is awful — the adults say it can take at least half a month to reach you, and if we're unlucky it might take a month. By the time you read this I will probably already know the results, but I believe getting a perfect score won't be a problem.

The last question in the math test was a geometry proof. I remembered the prompt and attached it at the end! It's novel and tricky, but I'm sure you can solve it. Without you competing with me for first place, exams feel so dull.

Have you already started training? I'm so curious — is it physics, or military theory? Or are you in actual combat classes already? Make sure to tell me!

Waiting for your reply!

Your friend,
Disar



### Alliance Year 47, October 25

Dear Disar,

Nice to hear from you!!

I received your letter this morning!! Do you know? All the communications here are extremely, extremely strict — my personal terminal can't receive messages directly; they have to be routed through a special department. Sending a reply is even more complicated — I spent half the day running the procedures to get this message out! Still, seeing your handwriting made me so happy.

I also did the math problem you attached! I drew a lot of auxiliary lines before I found the approach, and when I finished I realized there was actually a much simpler method… If it were you, you'd probably spot it right away, wouldn't you?

The courses here are intense! Guess what I'm studying now? Electrical engineering and the basics of aerodynamics! These are university-level classes! The teachers say it's all to prepare for Shipsian combat. It's hard, but I'm managing to keep up. I really want to send you the textbooks to study together, but it's forbidden.

And one really special thing: this year I'm the only new student in the entire galaxy detected as a Shipsian! Marshal Fujin personally gives some of my lessons — even history is taught by him! Sounds glorious, right? But it's basically torture — one-on-one instruction, three teachers and ten cameras watching me… The student dorm is empty; it's just me. I miss having classmates at my side.

Still, receiving your letters makes me feel less lonely! Thank you for keeping me company. Even across such a vast sea of stars, I can feel you near.

Missing you — waiting for your reply!

Your friend,
Phoenix



### Alliance Year 47, October 5

Dear Phoenix,

Phoenix! Your parents suddenly said they're moving, but they didn't tell me the new address! If you know it, you must write and tell me!! I haven't received your reply yet, so I'm sending this first!

Your friend,
Disar



### Alliance Year 47, November 14

Dear Disar,

Nice to hear from you!

You're so lucky — I had just sent you a letter and the next day I got your new message! Thank you for telling me about my parents' move!

The staff said that because I'm a Shipsian, my parents are under Alliance protection and have moved to Archology CQ-6. Yes — the jungle planet where many wealthy people have vacation homes. If you ever visit, you can drop by and see them!

At the Alliance I learned that Shipsian warriors are grouped into three kinds: those who participate in regular patrols and combat, those who serve primarily in logistics and support, and those embedded within human forces. They told us that at eighteen we will face a massive exam: passing qualifies you for the first two types; failure means being downgraded to the third. Terrifying, but I'm determined to pass! You must keep working hard too — we promised to meet again at the Prometheus Array!

I've met many Shipsian seniors! There's Yoth-hola who runs a strawberry-ice-cream cart in the dorm hall, Reaper who stands at the cafeteria doors to make sure everyone eats properly, and EX04239 who always wears a mask and a white exoskeleton… they are all so unique!

Oh no, my message limit is exceeded — I'll continue next time. Please write back soon!

Your friend,
Phoenix



### Alliance Year 47, December 1

Dear Phoenix,

I received your letter! No need to thank me — writing to you is nothing, though it does cost a bit of pocket money, so be economical with words next time!

I'm really envious that you can make so many Shipsian friends at the base. Don't worry — I'll work hard too! My parents say we might move to a place with better education, which will give me more chance to qualify for the Alliance. I'm truly grateful for their support; it's given me confidence. Trust me!

If we move successfully, I will send you the new address right away. Don't forget to change the recipient!

Missing you,
Disar



### Alliance Year 47, December 10

Dear Phoenix,

Nice to hear from you!

Yesterday something super embarrassing happened at school: during PE I ran too fast and crashed into a delivery robot on the field, scattering parts everywhere — the whole class laughed. My face was burning! The teacher punished me by having me reassemble the robot; I worked until midnight to patch it back together.

You would mock me, wouldn't you? Hmph — next time I'll beat you on the exam so you won't look down on me!

Whenever I make a fool of myself, I really wish you were here. I know you'd laugh and hand me a tissue instead of laughing until you doubled over.

Write back soon! Missing you!

Your friend,
Disar





### Alliance Year 47, December 24

Dear Disar,

Nice to hear from you!

Good luck with your finals! I've been swamped — so many extra military-related topics to study. Luckily, Christmas is coming on Earth, and we got two days off thanks to Marshal Fujin! He mentioned his hometown is a small island country on Earth. It's my first time celebrating Christmas; I'm planning to gorge on Earth food!

Are you moving? Thinking that the houses where we grew up will have new occupants makes me a little sad. Maybe that's what adults call "homesickness." It's funny to use that word — maybe we've grown up a bit?

Also — since you asked to be economical with words, why don't we use a secret code? Like omitting greetings? We're best friends; we don't need formalities!

Waiting for your reply!

Also missing you,
Phoenix



### Alliance Year 48, January 1

Dear Disar!!!!!!!

Happy New Year!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Excited,
Phoenix





### Alliance Year 48, January 25

Dear Phoenix,

Nice to hear from you.

Sorry for replying so late. The finals… I did terribly. My parents said it's because I was running to the communications office so often that I neglected my studies. I knew I should focus, but back then if I could read your words I'd do anything — and now I realize I was too headstrong.

There's more: we've moved to a new school that operates under closed management. Students live on campus and parental contact is strictly limited. Even worse, the fee to send a single letter from here to the Prometheus Array has skyrocketed several times; my parents say we can no longer afford frequent letters. Most importantly, they no longer allow me to correspond privately with you.

So from now on I probably can't reply like before. I will show your letters to my parents and try to have them pass messages to me, but I can't promise they'll deliver any replies. Maybe you won't receive any more of my words — I'm sorry and very sad about that.

Please don't stop writing because of me — every letter you send is something I secretly read over and over under the covers. I'll try to persuade them, but it may take time.

See you at graduation. Don't forget me.

I'll always, always miss you,
Disar



### Alliance Year 48, February 19

Dear Disar,

Nice to hear from you!

I've just realized — I won't have summer or winter breaks!!!

Marshal Fujin told us that because Shipsians are extremely rare and the galaxy urgently needs new forces, we finish theory at sixteen and then go directly into two years of simulated combat training. When you take the Alliance entrance exam, I should be a formal warrior — as long as I graduate!

I really want to travel beyond the Prometheus Array — especially to Archology CQ-6. That jungle planet must be beautiful…

Wishing you all the best!

Waiting for your reply,
Phoenix



### Alliance Year 48, March 4

Dear Disar,

Long time no see!

Have you started school? How was your break? I hardly had any time to relax. Since your school is closed-off, I suppose your vacations are spent on campus too — that must be boring, like mine.

The teachers say the difficulty is increasing! I'm the only student, yet there are nine different courses and instructors rotating through, and they all have high ranks — there's no slacking off allowed!

I want to go out and play so badly…

Missing you,
Phoenix



### Alliance Year 48, June 10

Dear Disar,

Long time no letters…

Nine courses are exhausting. In a regular university you could cut class, but not here — every subject relates to combat. You must be busy too, so I can't slack off! Thinking of working alongside you in the future keeps me going.

Keep it up! Let's work hard together!

Your friend,
Phoenix



### Alliance Year 48, August 30

Dear Disar,

I broke my promise.

I said I'd write more, but homework and training have swallowed me whole. Your summer is probably ending — by my count we've been apart for nearly half a year.

How are you?

Sometimes I really hope to receive just one unexpected reply from you, even a single sentence would do. Honestly.

Missing you,
Phoenix



### Alliance Year 48, September 15

Dear Disar,

Nice to hear from you.

There was a small accident in training today — I tripped inside the vacuum-adaptation chamber! You know how once you start moving in zero-g it can be hard to stop… I ended up tumbling around the chamber and bashed into the walls a few times before I steadied myself. Ten instructors and a bunch of cameras were there to "watch" my fall… I wanted to find a hole to hide in.

If you had been here you'd have laughed until your stomach hurt.

Sometimes I wish the teachers weren't so severe and that there were more peers my age. But alas… it's only me here.

Your friend,
Phoenix





### Alliance Year 48, October 3

Dear Disar,

We've been apart for almost a year — time goes by so fast.

I've been very busy and tired. When will I receive one of your replies? Sometimes I wonder if saying "I miss you" has itself become a kind of luxury.

It's almost midnight. Good night.

Your friend,
Phoenix



### Alliance Year 48, November 1

Dear Disar,

Nice to hear from you.

Nothing much to report, but I wanted to write just to let you know I'm doing okay. Don't worry — the Alliance doesn't give me much allowance, but it's enough to send you lots of letters.

Good morning, good afternoon, good evening.

Your friend,
Phoenix



### Alliance Year 49, January 1

Dear Disar,

Happy New Year!

A few days ago I went to a Christmas party — my second time celebrating. It was more boring than last year: the host was a dull engineer and very few Shipsians came.

I decided to go to the lawn after dinner and lie there with an ice cream, watching the stars.

Ceres Major itself doesn't glow, but I know you're somewhere among those stars. Maybe you're looking up right now too. When will we meet again? Maybe that is a luxury we can't afford.

I'm getting closer to eighteen. We'll meet, like that meteor shower whose tails crossed in the sky — two lights from different worlds, woven in the same heavens.

Tonight I'm indulging: I won't go back to the dorms, I'll sleep on the grass. Even if I get scolded or catch a cold — let me bathe in the countless indifferent gazes of the galaxy and dream.

Your friend,
Phoenix



### Alliance Year 49, April 28

Dear Disar,

Nice to hear from you.

I've been busy, but everything's fine.
I hope you are busy and fulfilled too — and happy. I miss you.

Well, that's all for now.

Your friend,
Phoenix



### Alliance Year 49, August 22

Dear Disar,

Nice to hear from you.

I still didn't receive your reply today.
The exams are tough, but I barely passed. If I had failed, the whole grade would have failed — ha.

I'll keep waiting.
Bye for now.

Your friend,
Phoenix



### Alliance Year 49, October 11

Dear Disar,

Nice to hear from you.

Another year already?
I'm fine — please don't worry.
May you be safe and well.

Your friend,
Phoenix



### Alliance Year 50, January 1

Dear Disar,

Happy New Year!

This year's Christmas party was more entertaining than last year's. Marshal Fujin finally had time to host.

I'm about to enter the third year of theory studies. This will be the busiest year and I may write even less. The following two years are practical training and will be even tougher, but I am determined to graduate perfectly so I can become a proper warrior.

Wishing you all the best.

Your friend,
Phoenix



### Alliance Year 50, September 2

Dear Disar,

Nice to hear from you.

The final theory exam went well; I am about to enter the two years of simulated combat.
I only wrote two letters this year — maybe next year I'll write only one. Ha.

But I'll try my best to write more.
Wishing you well.

Your friend,
Phoenix



### Alliance Year 51, January 1

Dear Disar,

Happy New Year, Disar.

The intense training hasn't left me injured; indeed, the Shipsian physique is resilient.
Still… it's really tiring.

The lights of the vacuum training ground stay on all night, and the starry sky beyond that glow feels even more distant.

I miss you and hope you are well.

Your friend,
Phoenix



### Alliance Year 51, April 20

Dear Disar,

Nice to hear from you.

I finally had a rare day off and spent it thinking about what to share with you. I wrote a very long letter but ended up deleting two-thirds of it — not because of the length limit but because I'm afraid writing too much will only make you feel more distant.
Tonight, during a surprise drill the instructors held, we finished late. On the way back I looked up and saw the sky full of stars. I suddenly thought: if I could write my name on a star, would you see it when you look up? When I become a warrior and can carry out missions on faraway uninhabited worlds, I'll arrange a hundred lights to spell "Phoenix" — who knows if technology or telescopes will advance enough in the coming years?

I really want to whisper these things in your ear and tell you everything I've seen lately.

— The rest of the letter is buried in the communications terminal's recycle bin.

Your friend,
Phoenix





### Alliance Year 51, June 3

Dear Disar,

Nice to hear from you.

The first year of simulated combat is over.
Military training is really hard, but I will keep going. I can now fully adapt to vacuum-like environments, and sometimes I can feel myself getting stronger — perhaps I'm well on my way to becoming a qualified warrior.

Walking back to the dorm late at night, I passed the training ground; the wind sounded like someone whispering. At times like that I almost mistook it for you.

It's late. Good night — be well.

Your friend,
Phoenix



### Alliance Year 51, December 8

Dear Disar,

So tired.

Sometimes I feel like you've become the confidant I always talk to in my head.
Even though I haven't received a reply for so many years, I still imagine your expression when I write. Would you laugh? Would you worry? — though there's really no need to worry.

Today I nearly made a serious mistake in an exercise and was scolded harshly by the instructor. But thinking that you might one day read these words lightened my mood a little.

Wishing you well.

Your friend,
Phoenix



### Alliance Year 52, January 2

Dear Disar,

Belated Happy New Year.

This year wasn't easy, but I made it through.

I saw the season's first snow fall on the steel surfaces outside the spaceport; it made no sound, only cold. For a moment I wished you could see it too. I heard on the weather report that Ceres Major has heavy snowfall this year — do you have time to build a snowman?
May you be safe and well. Don't forget me.

Your friend,
Phoenix





### Alliance Year 52, June 6

Dear Disar,

I'm about to graduate. When that happens, this student mailbox will be erased. During the gap before my new mailbox is activated they issued me an old military communicator with the channel code **X7Q9L2HP**. With this channel I can receive messages within ten minutes — if you can reach me, please do send a message.

The graduation exam will be very difficult, but I will give it my all. Much of what kept me going these past five years came from you. Thank you. We'll meet soon, won't we? I can't wait to say these words to you in person:

Long time no see, Disar — my friend.

Your friend,
Phoenix
