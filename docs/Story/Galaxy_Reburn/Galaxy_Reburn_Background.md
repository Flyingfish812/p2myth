# Background Setting of *Reburn the Galaxy*

## History Before the Story

In the first year of the Galactic Alliance, the army from the Void World launched their initial attack on the Galaxy. The weapons used by the Galactic inhabitants were utterly ineffective against the Void Army, causing panic among the planets. An emergency alliance was formed, known as the Galactic Alliance Army, aka G.A.A..

After painstaking efforts, the Galaxy still found itself helpless against the attacks from the Void Army. Many planets were consumed by the void world, leaving only a few inhabited by humans: the Ceres Major, the Earth, Zhey Auna, and the Blight. 

Through united defense, the G.A.A. managed to barely withstand two rounds of attacks after four years of fierce battles.

In the fourth year of the Alliance, the Blight suffered a massive assault. G.A.A. paid a heavy price to defeat the enemy, achieving their first victory for the Alliance. The Blight was left in ruins, renamed the "Blight Sector," becoming the frontier of the Alliance. This war was later known as the "Blight War." For a considerable period after that, the Galaxy did not face any further large-scale attacks.

Ten years into the Alliance, a significant event that affected the entire galaxy occurred. Blood tests discovered a group of individuals with mutated physiology during a medical examination of the Alliance Army. They were named the "Shipsians" and were incorporated into the military ranks, trained as natural-born warriors.

Subsequently, the story of "Reburn the Galaxy" unfolds.

## About Races

- Shipsians

    A unique race. They appear no different from ordinary humans but possess many special abilities - they can withstand the vacuum of space, moving through it without the need for space suits. Born resilient and mighty, with extraordinary physical abilities, they are formidable warriors.

    Almost all Shipsians choose to join the Galactic Alliance Army, becoming warriors. They possess powerful and unique "Main Weapons," as well as "Aura" and "Zen" equipment for combat support.

    After the Blight War, this race first appeared in the universe. They do not inherit through reproduction but rather mutate from ordinary humans postnatally. Therefore, every child undergoes a test at thirteen to identify the Shipsians hidden among ordinary people.

- Ana-Shipsians

    They are a very special subset of Shipsians who, for committing crimes or refusing to fulfill their duties, are punished by being deprived of the right to possess "Main Weapons," "Aura," and "Zen." They are dubbed "Ana," which in ancient Blythe language means "traitor."

- Beastmen

    They possess partial animal features and are indigenous to some planets. They may appear fierce, but they are the most honest folks in the universe.

## About Planets

- Ceres Major 

    The most giant inhabited planet in the Galactic Alliance.

- Zhey Auna

    The second largest inhabited planet in the Alliance.

- The Earth

    A typical blue planet, the third largest inhabited planet.

- Prometheus Array

    A minor planet responsible for housing the base of the Galactic Alliance Army, which guards the Milky Way. Shipsians who become warriors train and live here. Almost all Hipsians reside here.

- Gau Prime

    A technologically advanced planet, the second-largest base of the Galactic Alliance Army, is also home to many civilians.

- Arcology

    It is a minor planet rich in resources, serving as a natural habitat for flora and fauna, a natural laboratory for scientists, and a vacation spot for the wealthy.

- Dovacoon Forge

    A planet that has become the industrial hub of the entire galaxy due to its abundant mineral resources, earning the title of "Forge." The three types of equipment for Hipsian warriors are all forged here.

- Blight Sector

    A desolate wasteland that has become a barren planet.

    This is where the earliest large-scale war to defend the galaxy took place. Since then, the once prosperous Blight has transformed into a war-zone .

    Few humans can survive here, and only a few resilient Shipsian warriors are stationed here.

## Others

- Warp Gate

    Appreciate the Warp Gates!!

    The Warp Gate is hailed as one of the greatest inventions, allowing instantaneous teleportation to the location of another Warp Gate. It serves not only as a means to reach destinations quickly but also as a way for Shipsians to escape from the battlefield swiftly.
