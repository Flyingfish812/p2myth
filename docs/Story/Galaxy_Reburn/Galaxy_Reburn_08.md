### 1

Proxymar slightly tipped his hat as a gesture of greeting.

"H-hello!" Disar was the first to bow nervously, then turning to see Phoenix still staring blankly at Proxymar, she quickly gave her friend's hand a discreet tap.

"Oh—hello!" Phoenix finally came to her senses, and noticing from the corner of her eye that Disar was bowing, she immediately bent forward to show respect as well.

Proxymar laughed heartily, placing his hands on their shoulders, indicating: "No need to be so formal, children. You're not Alliance Army soldiers, there's no need to salute us."

Phoenix felt the gentle pressure on her shoulder and straightened up accordingly, meeting Proxymar's gaze.

"It's a great honor to meet you, Mr. Proxymar!" Disar said, standing ramrod straight. In contrast, Phoenix appeared notably more relaxed.

Proxymar raised his left arm and tapped twice on his wrist with his right hand. A small wristband device immediately activated, projecting a light blue holographic screen.

"According to regulations, non-Alliance Army personnel can only stay here for one day. It's already late night in the Prometheus Array, so your blood tests have been scheduled for tomorrow morning," Proxymar explained. "I've come to escort you both to your accommodations—I presume you can read Galactic Standard?"

The projection displayed a map with lines of Galactic Standard text pointing to a guest room with arrows. The characters, which combined features from various planetary writing systems, made it easy for Disar to recognize her own name.

"Disar, Visitor Reception Area..." Phoenix read quietly.

Disar examined the map thoroughly. The names of various facilities were labeled in detail in multiple languages, but there were no characters representing "Phoenix" anywhere. Thinking she might have missed something, she rubbed her eyes and looked carefully again, but still couldn't find a second marker.

"Wait, what about me?" Phoenix wondered aloud.

Hearing this, Disar became more certain of her observation: "Phoenix isn't staying here?"

"I'm embarrassed to say that with so many visitors to headquarters recently, there's only one single-occupancy room left in the Visitor Reception Area."

"Ah..." Phoenix looked away awkwardly, "Disar and I could squeeze in together, sorry for the inconvenience..."

Proxymar looked at Phoenix and continued: "Fortunately, a Shipsian warrior has agreed to share their quarters, so I'm afraid Miss Phoenix will have to stay in the Shipsian residential area for the night."

"—Where?"

Phoenix froze, as if rooted to the spot, staring directly into Proxymar's eyes.

The Shipsian residential area?
Living with active-duty Shipsian warriors?!

"Is it me?"

"That's right."

"Really?!"

She could hardly believe it, exclaiming loudly.

Proxymar nodded with a smile.

Phoenix nearly fainted from excitement. She had thought that merely meeting many Shipsians, or even sharing a room with them, would be incredibly fortunate. After all, for ordinary citizens, these great warriors only appeared in their lives as news headlines or television programs.

To be able to interact with them at such close proximity felt like she had used up a lifetime's worth of luck.

"Aaaah! Phoenix, you're so lucky!!" 

Disar pounced on Phoenix, messing up her hair.

"I'm so jealous of you, Phoenix! I want to stay with the Shipsian warriors too!"

"Stop it, stop messing with my hair!"

"You've used up ten lifetimes of luck already!"

While Phoenix and Disar were playfully tussling, Proxymar made a gesture for silence.

"You may not realize it, but it's already deep night at the base. According to Alliance rules, loud noises are not permitted during this time." Proxymar lowered his voice, showing them his watch, which pointed to one o'clock in the morning.

"By rights, Hime should have arrived by now—ah, perfect timing."

Phoenix felt her eardrums vibrate slightly and instinctively thought about the source of the sound.

Is that the sound of thrusters?

A platinum figure rose floating from below the staircase. Hime was flying up vertically from outside the stairs, her skirt dancing in the air as the leg thrusters disturbed the airflow.

"I apologize for the delay. I had some urgent matters to attend to, so I asked Commander Proxymar to wait for you here."

Proxymar watched as Hime landed beside Phoenix and Disar, explaining her tardiness, and said in a teasing tone: "What's this? Does no one want to use the external stairs anymore these days?"

"Well, we have friends here who want to see more high-tech capabilities," Hime said, winking at the two young visitors.

"Can thruster sounds really be that quiet?" Phoenix asked somewhat distractedly, only to receive a poke in the arm from Disar, after which she scratched her head to indicate she hadn't meant to interrupt.

"Well then, Hime... according to the plan, you'll escort Miss Disar to the Visitor Reception Area," Proxymar said, turning his gaze to Phoenix. "I'll be responsible for taking Phoenix to the Shipsian residential area."

Hmm?

Hearing this, Phoenix felt an inexplicable confusion, but nodded nonetheless.

"Let's not delay any further. Shall we go?"

### 2

After saying goodbye to Disar and Hime, Phoenix walked silently alongside Proxymar, heading toward the Shipsian residential area.

She had to admit, after everything that had happened, she was exhausted.

It had only been half a day since the moment she first heard the space liner's alarm. In those few short hours, she had experienced things most people wouldn't encounter in a lifetime.

Thinking back now, she still couldn't believe she'd had the courage—facing a laser that could vaporize her in a second, yet still pulling on the machine gun controls.

The time she spent unconscious on the patrol ship hadn't restored her energy as much as she'd hoped. Both physical and mental fatigue weighed on her, and Phoenix just walked with her head down, saying nothing.

The Alliance military base was extremely quiet at night. When she had arrived earlier, the port had been bustling with activity. But in just one hour, the entire world seemed to have hit a mute button. There were no more transport machines or workers moving about on the ground, and the buzzing of drones in the air had ceased.

From the corner of her eye, she noticed the large clocks visible everywhere, with hands pointing to an area marked in blue, with a legend explaining: Silent Rest Period.

So they stopped all work to ensure Alliance personnel could rest?

It was so quiet... it made her drowsy.

Phoenix yawned, then shook her head to try to stay awake.

"Phoenix."

Commander Proxymar suddenly spoke, breaking the stillness of the empty base.

"C-Commander?" Phoenix responded to his call with confusion and nervousness.

Why is the commander suddenly calling me? Is he going to ask about the ambush earlier? But I've already told them everything! She felt her heartbeat automatically speed up.

"Tired?"

"Huh?"

Phoenix was momentarily slow to respond, her throat squeezing out a confused sound.

Proxymar smiled and brought his watch close to Phoenix's face.

The small watch screen reflected a face.

Phoenix was somewhat surprised, because she saw a face that showed indescribable exhaustion. Even as she made a surprised expression, her stiff facial muscles betrayed her fatigue.

"Sorry, sir. I don't know why I suddenly feel so sleepy..."

"We still have some distance to go. Would you mind if I carried you, miss?"

"No, no, no, please don't trouble yourself. I can walk on my own."

Phoenix immediately tensed up, frantically waving her hands to indicate she didn't need help.

"Then let's talk about something to help you stay awake." Proxymar withdrew his arm and looked up at the sky. "Let me think... what do children your age usually like to talk about... How about dreams? What are your dreams?"

Dreams?

Phoenix immediately had an answer in her heart.

"I... I want to become a Shipsian warrior."

"Oh? That kind of tone won't do."

Phoenix was taken aback, but quickly understood.

"I want to be a Shipsian warrior!"

Proxymar smiled and asked, "And why is that? I hear your grades are good, and after this incident, the Alliance will certainly offer you some special privileges. Getting into the Alliance military won't be too difficult. Once you're in, you could be a researcher or a commander. Why must you be a warrior?"

Without hesitation, Phoenix gave her answer.

"Because it can become other hopes."

Proxymar paused, seemingly surprised by a reason beyond his expectations. His mouth opened slightly, but no sound came out.

Phoenix, as if remembering something, added: "Disar thinks the same way—we've known each other since we were little. She's much more talented than I am. I always thought she must be a Shipsian."

Even without the sounds of machinery, the lights of the Galactic Alliance military base remained bright throughout the night. The harsh white light enveloped the metal ground, reflecting onto the young girl. The blue tips of her hair fluttered in the breeze created by her walking, and those golden pupils of hers shone exceptionally bright, like a pair of canaries bathing in sunlight, more like her former self.

Proxymar didn't respond, only pausing his steps for a moment, looking ahead for a while before finally speaking.

"...Is that so." His tone was flat, unlike the casual manner when he had initiated the conversation earlier, but a hint of disappointment was discernible. Then, as if muttering to himself, he quietly added, "So it's what they call destiny."

Proxymar didn't speak further, and Phoenix gradually calmed down.

Chatting did help fight drowsiness, but once she stopped thinking and responding, she inevitably fell back into sleepiness—especially now with the silent commander and child.

Drowsiness swept over her again.

She thought she saw something green flash by. Phoenix looked up slightly but saw nothing.

Perhaps she really needed to sleep immediately; she was already having hallucinations, Phoenix thought.

Just then, Phoenix noticed Proxymar suddenly slow his pace.

Her hearing caught an extremely harsh sound.

A point of purple entered her vision.

In that instant—

—it came tearing through the air.

"—Get down!"

Proxymar roared, deploying the fishbone-shaped main cannon from his back in the blink of an eye. Electricity flashed chaotically, thunder crackled, and a bolt of lightning immediately coiled around his arm, shooting straight forward to collide with an incoming purple blade of light.

"BOOM—"

The explosion erupted less than ten meters from Phoenix.

Phoenix's body froze. Her survival instinct urged her to run away, but she couldn't move an inch.

Call for help! Someone will hear me!

Phoenix tried to scream, but her throat wouldn't respond.

What's happening? What's going on?

Why can't I move?

Why can't I make a sound?

Why? Why?

"I didn't expect the famous new commander to be here as well. A miscalculation, indeed."

A middle-aged man wearing a tattered cloak emerged from the corner. His hat couldn't hide his yellowish-green hair, and his golden eyes glowed eerily from beneath the brim.

The explosion's smoke seemed to trigger the sensors, and a piercing alarm sounded.

"Tch, annoying."

The man raised his hand, fingers straight and tight like a blade, then casually swung. A rectangular wave of energy shot out, slicing the alarm system in two.

Proxymar's expression was grave as he stared intently at the unwelcome visitor.

"Tri. ni. ty."

He gritted his teeth, pronouncing each syllable of the intruder's name.

"Wanted criminal, how did you get in here?!"

"I have to thank those who, like me, see the situation clearly."

Trinity extended his hand, his fingertips surrounded by a faint purple light, his tone somewhat contemptuous.

"You realize that by appearing here, I now have the authority to kill you on sight."

Proxymar's voice deepened as he stood in front of the immobilized Phoenix.

Why? Why?

That courage that had faced death by laser beam without fear didn't surge within her now.

Why is this happening?

Phoenix seemed completely frozen in place, only her trembling pupils, shaking with fear, indicated she was alive.

"Kill me? Do you have what it takes, boy?" Trinity sneered, the blue light on his chest particularly bright.

"What do you want, Ana-shipsian?"

"What do I want? Don't you know already?"

Trinity revealed his ferocious face, raising his arm as a purplish light danced along the outside of his limb. That was his Main Weapon.

"Hand her over—"

Phoenix suddenly realized his gaze, which seemed capable of tearing everything apart, had fallen on her.

"—Phoenix II."

"Proxymar's fishbone-shaped Lightning Conduit erupted with even stronger electrical current.

"Hmph, dream on!"

"Boy, you're not qualified to challenge me!"

Lightning and blade light began to charge simultaneously, as if they would collide again in just an instant. Phoenix watched everything before her in terror, trying to distance herself from this battlefield that seemed capable of swallowing her whole in the next second, but her body, as if offline, completely refused to obey her commands.

There seemed to be another presence approaching from behind. She held her breath, her tension reaching an unprecedented peak.

She wanted to turn around to see who was behind her. She prayed it was Imei, Aries, or Wuxing, or even that Nimbus. Many unfamiliar Shipsian faces flashed through her mind—from newspapers, from television—her thoughts gradually becoming incredibly chaotic.

Please, whoever you are, come save me...

"Both of you, stop right there."

Phoenix heard a "click-clack" sound above her head.

A strange man walked past Phoenix. The source of the sound was the gray-white light machine gun on his shoulder, projecting holographic crosshairs.

"Trinity, that's enough."

The gray-haired man looked up at Trinity.

"Long time no see, Corsair."

Trinity furrowed his brow as he spoke the other's name.

The man called Corsair wore white and gold clothing adorned with various bullets, each seemingly engraved with something.

"Meeting again in such circumstances, old friend, is rather unfortunate."

"Heh." Trinity still held up his arm, making a contemptuous sound. "You should be one of the people who understands the truth best! Corsair—the chance to save her, to save us all, is right before our eyes!"

The man named Corsair sighed, the lieutenant commander rank insignia on the side of his pirate captain's hat reflecting light. Phoenix noticed the long scar on his left eye, extending from his forehead all the way down to his cheek.

"Don't you understand yet? That person is already dead. She has her own independent will, and those past events have nothing to do with her." Corsair's brows furrowed deeply as the light machine gun on his shoulder emitted a faint rumble.

"How ridiculous, Corsair. In my presence, you dare not even speak her name?" 

Trinity maintained his standoff with Corsair, looking down at him with a condescending gaze and speaking in a rhetorical tone.

What? Why? Why has it come to this? What are they talking about?

Phoenix's mind was simultaneously assaulted by fear and confusion. Though she didn't understand why any of this was happening, she clearly knew these people were coming for her. However, in such a volatile situation, she would likely become a casualty on the spot.

"Proxymar, take her away."

Corsair continued staring at Trinity, speaking in a low voice.

Proxymar didn't hesitate for even a second. Mechanical sounds tore through the silent air as the fishbone-shaped Main Weapon immediately disassembled into countless tiny components, retracting beneath Proxymar's coat.

"Phoenix, hold tight!"

He immediately turned and grabbed the completely frozen Phoenix, almost lifting her from the ground with one arm, then swinging her onto his back.

Caught off guard by the sudden movement, Phoenix felt her body finally regain some control. Her fingers tightly gripped Proxymar's shoulders to prevent herself from falling.

"Not so fast!"

Before the words faded, Trinity vanished from his spot. Accompanied by a blinding green light, Phoenix saw him suddenly appear above her head.

A purple flash.

But it wasn't Trinity's purple blade wave.

Space seemed to freeze for an instant as a massive purple light pillar blocked Trinity's path.

Proxymar seized the moment, the thrusters on his legs activating instantly, carrying Phoenix away at extreme speed.

What's happening...

In the howling wind, Phoenix felt her mind growing dizzy.

Before consciousness completely abandoned her, she heard an angry roar from behind.

"Mirage——!!!"

### 5

Complete darkness.

"Beep, beep."

"Wa..."

"Beep, beep."

"Lis..."

"Beep, beep."

"Up..."

"Beeeep—"

"Phoenix?"

"Ah!"

Phoenix cried out as she sat up in bed.

"Having a nightmare?"

Phoenix suddenly realized she was lying on a soft single bed, and the persistent beeping sound was coming from an alarm clock.

"Um, I..."

Phoenix looked up to see a woman standing by her bedside.

"You were shouting things like 'don't kill me' and 'help' just now. Are you alright...?"

She instinctively examined the person before her. Judging by appearance, the woman was roughly twenty years old, with brown hair so long its ends nearly reached her knees. Her bangs were somewhat messy, just barely covering her right eye. The visible left eye conveyed an inexplicable sadness.

"I'm sorry... um... may I ask what happened last night?"

"Last night, you were already asleep when you arrived at the dormitory. Commander Proxymar carried you back," the woman answered in a gentle yet somewhat heavy voice. "You can call me Banshee."

"Banshee—madam." Phoenix uncertainly added the respectful suffix after the other's name.

Last night...

What happened last night?

Phoenix blinked.

She remembered saying goodbye to Disar with Proxymar, then heading toward the Shipsian dormitory area.

After that...

After that, she suddenly felt drowsy while walking.

And then...

There was no "and then."

"Ah!"

Phoenix suddenly slapped her face as realization struck her.

Did I really fall asleep while walking yesterday?

And in front of a Galactic Alliance Military commander?

And was carried back by the commander?!

I hope I didn't talk in my sleep the whole way!

Phoenix pinched herself in disbelief.

"No need to worry. The nightmares might be some lingering effects from your direct exposure to the Judgment Day laser," Banshee's lips curled slightly in what appeared to be a smile, though it carried a bitter undertone.

"Just now... I had a strange dream. I'm sorry, Miss Banshee..." Phoenix scratched her head to hide her embarrassment. "I dreamed someone was trying to kill me—but I've been having all sorts of weird dreams for a long time now."

Everything made sense now. In that dream, she couldn't move or call out—the standard configuration of a nightmare. Her brain's dream factory wasn't working properly again.

Phoenix knocked on her forehead.

"The time for the test... is approaching," Banshee smiled as she handed over a towel. "Here."

Phoenix nodded, extending both hands to receive the warm cloth from her.
