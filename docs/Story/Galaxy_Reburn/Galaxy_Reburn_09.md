"So... isn't it called a 'blood test'...?"

Phoenix questioned the camera in the bright, pure white room. She looked helplessly at the safety clasps restraining her limbs, as "click-click" sounds echoed through the space—the sound of mechanical restraints automatically closing.

She was lying on something resembling an operating table, while Disar lay on another parallel surface not far away, in the same situation, showing a hint of concern. Phoenix shuddered at the sight of tangled electrical wires hanging overhead and device indicator lights twinkling like stars.

"We followed the signs to the 'blood test' room... right?" 

Disar said with little confidence, twisting slightly to find a more comfortable position. Her short black hair generated static electricity against the surface, causing a tingling pain that made her feet twitch, her ankles hitting the inside of the restraints with dull thuds.

Phoenix nodded as much as she could, answering, "That's right, and we lay down here as instructed."

Phoenix had heard about the blood test procedure from senior students. The process was supposed to be quite simple—just drawing a few vials of blood, then going home to wait for the test report—not being strapped to an operating table like this.

Fortunately, Phoenix clearly knew she was "inside the Prometheus Array." Otherwise, she would certainly have thought she'd been lured to some remote lawless place where she was about to be gutted.

"But somehow I feel like... our lives might be in danger?" 

Phoenix tried to use humor to help Disar relax, but the slight tremor in her voice betrayed her.

"Reading complete, identification code G.A.A.S.Zhetass, mechanic authority confirmed, access granted."

The door at the other end of the room suddenly opened, with an unexpected voice sounding. Phoenix was about to say something when she was interrupted by this mechanical voice coming from beyond the door.

"—Of course not!"

Emerging from the other side of the door wasn't a tall mechanic or a doctor in a white coat, but a small boy wearing an Alliance military uniform. He was somewhat frail, looking only about ten years old, and didn't resemble a mechanic at all except for the tool pack on his back that seemed heavy enough to crush him, giving him a slight semblance of a mechanic.

A child?

Phoenix was stunned—why would there be someone even younger than her in an Alliance military base?

The boy walked to the device between their operating tables. Phoenix tilted her head and saw the work badge hanging on his rust-colored clothes, which read: "Zhetass."

"You're in a military base, so the equipment naturally prioritizes war service. The blood test machines you normally see are too slow for actual interstellar warfare," Zhetass explained while skillfully activating various machines, turning knobs, and inputting something on holographic screens. "The machine you're using now was deployed by the Alliance ten years ago. Back then, it urgently detected large numbers of Shipsians, stabilizing the defensive positions that countless lives had secured. Even now, it remains of significant strategic importance—ahem, that's not classified."

Suddenly, he looked up to examine the bundles of wires on the ceiling, standing on tiptoe as if trying to reach a small switch hanging down. However, Zhetass wasn't tall enough and couldn't reach it despite several attempts.

"Um... do you need help..."

"【EYE】."

Disar had just begun asking if he needed assistance when she was interrupted by a harsh mechanical sound.

Following Zhetass's call, the tool pack emitted the sound of gears turning. Phoenix realized it wasn't an ordinary backpack but some kind of steel device disguised as one.

The "backpack" suddenly detached from his back and flew into the air. Then the shell split open, and like a magic show, various mechanical structures began operating in an instant. Extending, transforming, connecting—heavy and clanging. The two were too shocked to speak, watching as the metal grew thrusters, with layers of levers constructing claw-like shapes, ultimately transforming into a chilling form that cast a fearful shadow.

With just a glance from Zhetass, the metal giant hand moved, using the tip of its claw to pinch the wire and hand it to him.

"Hmm, the device is running well, preparations complete," Zhetass checked briefly, and the floating steel claw returned the wire exactly to its original height. "By the way, this machine does more than just blood tests. Now, lie still and don't move."

Hearing the young mechanic's command, the two girls obediently lay on the operating tables with deeply shocked hearts. The machine above slowly activated, delivering what looked like eye masks—perhaps VR glasses—that were placed over their faces.

"If you're a Shipsian, it will perform surgery on the spot—activating the Shipsian 'core.' And to ensure warriors can immediately join training and combat while fully alert, it doesn't use anesthetics to block pain—"

Before Zhetass could finish his last sentence, Phoenix lost consciousness before she could even scream.

"—Instead, it uses **hypnotic analgesia** technology."

She stood in a pure white space. Not the crystalline white of snow, nor the pristine white of paper, but an absolute nothingness that devoured everything. There were no shadows, no boundaries, even the air seemed solidified into a transparent entity. She tried to breathe, but couldn't tell if it was her chest rising and falling, or if the entire space was trembling slightly with her pulse.

There was nothing, yet somehow she could sense everything.

Phoenix blinked, looking around at the endless void. A word came to her mind—"white hole."

"Hello?" 

She questioned the air, but the air didn't reply. She waited a while, but no answer echoed off any walls. She counted her increasingly loud heartbeats until they became deafening drumbeats.

"Is anyone there?"

Of course not. She already knew the answer in her heart.

She lifted her toes, then gently set them down, creating ripples where they touched the ground. Phoenix paced around, but the scenery was identical everywhere, making it impossible to tell which direction she was moving. Walking back and forth, she couldn't find any beacon to guide her.

She knew she had just been lying on an operating table—perhaps this was the consciousness space mentioned in science fiction novels? She guessed that once the test ended, all this would be over.

Phoenix looked down at her body. She wore a white dress, its hem slowly dissolving into the space around her. Idly playing with the edge of her skirt, the silky texture comforted her. She changed position, hugging her knees to her chest as she sat on the ground, softly humming a nursery rhyme she'd heard somewhere.

"Stars grow into crescent moons, falling in my home they turn to watermelons;"

"The wind blows, swaying back and forth, silver sesame seeds in purple pulp."

Phoenix froze, looking behind her in bewilderment.

—Because she wasn't the one who had sung the second line.

A strange female voice had continued the nameless nursery rhyme. Air rubbing against vocal cords, gentle yet trembling, mature but with a trace of barely detectable sorrow, as if lamenting yet also accepting.

In the pure white space, another figure appeared. So distant, like a drop of sky blue accidentally fallen onto an infinitely large white canvas. Despite the distance, the song reached Phoenix's ears with perfect clarity.

There was someone here.

An inexplicable sense of salvation rose in her heart. Phoenix tried to call out, but found she couldn't make a sound. She waved her arms urgently, but there was no response from the other person.

"White chrysanthemums bloom beneath the starry river, in winter they die, to sprout again next year;"

Go to that person, Phoenix heard the call in her mind and felt her heart racing wildly as she tried to move toward the figure.

"White chrysanthemums bloom beneath the starry river, in spring they grow again, blooming tomorrow;"

Phoenix lifted her foot, her arms poised to swing forward, but in the next moment she felt a pulling force at her wrist.

"My love blooms beneath the starry river, today I sing of romance, tomorrow I'll say goodbye..."

Phoenix turned to look back, but before she could see what was holding her, she was pulled into darkness.

### 3

Complete darkness.

The darkness was like some alien life form, compressing every inch of the classroom, making even breathing feel viscous. Phoenix's cheek was buried deep in the crook of her arm, her skin sensing the static electricity generated from friction with her school uniform, as if the entire space was humming at a low frequency.

"Students—"

Mixed with the history teacher's lecture was an emotionless mechanical female voice.

"73 65 77 32..."

The voice didn't seem to come from the school's broadcast speakers, but rather echoed directly inside her skull. Each syllable carried subtle electronic static, like an old telegraph machine sending signals. Phoenix's temples throbbed, awakening some primitive alertness deep in her spinal cord.

"Please turn to page two hundred and twenty—"

"87 65 73..."

The numbers in the broadcast continued, but the sound of turning pages that should have filled the classroom was completely absent. Phoenix raised her head slightly, her eyelids heavy as lead. She squinted, looking around—

There was no one.

Thirty-six desks were arranged neatly, their surfaces reflecting a faint cold light, like rows of coffins awaiting burial.

"Today we'll be discussing—"

"84 73 78 71..."

Phoenix's fingers unconsciously gripped the edge of the desk, her nails creating tiny scratching noises against the plastic surface. The numerical codes in the broadcast continued without pattern, yet somehow reminded her of some kind of encryption.

"—the War of Blight."

The pronunciation of those five words pierced her eardrums. The teacher's narrative was like a stapler, driving each word deep into her brain. Struck by this unexpected phantom pain, Phoenix jolted, her spine hit by an electric current, launching her from her seat as her soul was torn from the mire of deep sleep.

"The War of Blight was a devastating war. Forty-two Roc-class enemy ships led hundreds upon hundreds of Void Army vessels, advancing toward the edge of the galaxy..."

The history teacher's voice was terrifyingly steady. Phoenix stared intently at the podium, trying to make out the teacher's face—

But there was only a blurry outline.

"32 70 79..."

The numbers in the broadcast continued. Phoenix's throat tightened as she tentatively spoke:

"Teacher... where did everyone go?"

No response.

The history teacher's voice continued as if her question had never existed:

"—we must remember the sacrifice of these four warriors, and then work hard for the construction of our Alliance..."

Phoenix's face turned pale. The desktop beneath her fingertips felt unusually smooth, causing her to instinctively lift her arms away.

Suddenly, the static in the broadcast intensified dramatically, the piercing noise like countless needles stabbing into her eardrums—

"82 32 89..."

At the same time, the classroom curtains billowed violently as a fierce wind rushed in. With her bangs chaotically slapping against her face, Phoenix immediately looked toward the window. Behind the wildly dancing curtains, a strange light faintly shone through.

After a moment's hesitation, Phoenix carefully rose from her seat, trying to keep the teacher's eerily blurry outline out of her field of vision. She moved toward the curtains and, suppressing the last trace of fear in her heart, raised her hand to pull them aside.

Outside the window was not the expected school campus, but an endless galaxy.

And within that galaxy floated thousands upon thousands of Void Army warships.

Their silhouettes resembled some ancient predator, with dark red energy patterns flowing across their hulls, pulsating like blood vessels. The hundreds of flagships in the front row—those massive warships called "Roc"—were slowly turning their laser cannons to aim directly at the classroom.

"79 85."

The numbers in the broadcast and the history teacher's voice stopped simultaneously. Phoenix's retinas were filled with blinding red light, her body frozen in place as her mind raced frantically through fear—

Was this an illusion? Or reality?
Those numbers...

Her consciousness collapsed like a broken dam, all emotions turning into a flood that tore her to pieces before the countless Doomsday Lasers could fire.

In the final second before the Doomsday Lasers fired, Phoenix realized something even before fear could take hold—

This classroom had never existed at all.

The machine emitted a piercing alarm.

The mechanical arm raised high, tools retreating into hidden sterilization chambers, signaling the end of the surgery.

The door reopened, and a procession of people entered. First came the now-familiar faces: Proxymar, Nimbus, Hime, and Zhetass. Behind them were several human officers from the Galaxy Alliance Army. Last was a tall, thin man with purple hair—the current Marshal of the Galaxy Alliance Army, Fujin.

When the machine above Phoenix's head emitted a dazzling sky-blue light, Proxymar, who stood at the front, breathed a sigh of relief.

"It seems we have a new little warrior."

Proxymar looked with satisfaction toward the eye-mask-like machine that slowly lifted away from the operating table. He wasn't looking at the report results displayed on the machine, but at the young girl gradually regaining consciousness.

"Mr. Proxymar...?"

Phoenix's consciousness was still foggy. Fujin was the first to respond, followed by applause echoing throughout the room and successive congratulations:

"Miss Phoenix, congratulations."

"Miss Phoenix, congratulations on achieving your wish."

"Ha, though we've only met once, I knew Miss Phoenix had talent!"

"Welcome to our ranks, Miss Phoenix."

"Congratulations! This old machine has finally found another one of our kind!"

Phoenix, just awakened from her subconscious, stared blankly at everything, suddenly noticing that her clothes had been changed to a white uniform.

She looked down at her chest and saw a faint green light shimmering beneath her clothes, like a small furnace of life.

Curious about this somewhat unfamiliar glow, Phoenix extended her index finger and poked her chest twice. It felt tingly to the touch, but warm.

"This is..."

"This is your Core. Miss Phoenix, you are a Shipsian," Marshal Fujin gently informed her of the news she had dreamed of.

"I am... a Shipsian."

Phoenix, supported by Hime beside her, sat cross-legged on the operating table. She examined her body and found that the only two changes were her clothing and this small Core.

"How does it feel? Do you feel like a new person?" asked Nimbus, adjusting his orange goggles.

Phoenix emptied her mind, closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and listened to her inner voice.

In countless fantasies, those ecstatic cheers and jumps now seemed unrealistic. At the moment when years of dreams became reality, the mirror-like lake of her heart merely rippled. This news, capable of changing her life's trajectory, didn't make her feel particularly excited.

"...To be honest, I feel exceptionally calm," Phoenix answered. "I thought I would be so excited that I'd stand up and shout, but I don't have that enthusiasm now. It's as if..."

"As if?"

"As if, somehow, I had already anticipated this moment, so I don't feel excited being here."

Everyone around suddenly fell silent, offering only reassuring glances.

"By the way, Disar—where is Disar?"

Phoenix suddenly realized her closest friend wasn't among the crowd and eagerly raised her head, looking around. Her anxious gaze swept through the gaps between onlookers, but she couldn't find that familiar figure. Only the cold light reflected from the metal walls cast uneasy shadows in her pupils.

"Miss Disar—" 

Hime deliberately turned her gaze to the floor, her voice still gentle but with a slight tremor.

"—she is not a Shipsian."

"...?"

What?

Phoenix froze.

Disar, not a Shipsian?

"Um... was there an error in the test?"

Phoenix suddenly felt her heart beating in a pathological rhythm, almost frantically pumping blood to her brain.

"Disar always outperformed me in exams, and her athletic performance was more outstanding. If I can be a Shipsian, she couldn't possibly not be—"

"—Miss Phoenix, genes don't lie, and tests don't make mistakes."

Fujin's voice, gentle yet tinged with guilt, rang out.

"Two retests showed the same results from the blood samples. Your dear friend Miss Disar does not have the distinctive mutated gene that can be detected in Shipsians at age 13."

Phoenix's fingertips, which had just warmed with recognition, plunged into an ice cellar in an instant. She heard something shatter deep within her heart—the crystal mural she and Disar had built together since they first met was now breaking into countless sharp edges, tearing at the margins of her heart's walls with an almost manic intensity, ripping apart her beliefs.

She remembered leaning against each other at the spaceport before departure, fantasizing about what kind of warriors they would become, adjusting their poses for cool battle stances.

She remembered those days racing at sports meets, where the two classmates always left other competitors far behind, praised by teachers for their outstanding talent and assured they would become excellent warriors.

The promise to become warriors together with Disar was vivid in her mind, all those images now tinged with the colors of farewell. She remembered too much, clogging her throat, leaving her speechless, with only bitterness on her tongue.

"Then, where is Disar..."

Phoenix asked, her voice hoarse.

"She woke up two hours before you. According to the Galaxy Alliance Army Base Visitor Regulation No. 42, non-Shipsian civilians unrelated to military affairs must leave within 12 hours of arrival." Zhetass tapped a few times on the holographic projector on his wrist, bringing up a surveillance video to explain to Phoenix. "In fifteen minutes, she will board the ship arranged by the base to return to Ceres Major. She should be at the base port now, where you both arrived."

In the surveillance footage, Disar stood with her heavy luggage at the port bustling with transport machinery, looking lonely yet calm at the platform where the spacecraft was about to land.

"No... I can't... I haven't said goodbye!"

Phoenix clenched her trembling fists, desperately bracing her wrists on the table surface before leaping down. Her still-numb legs made her stagger, nearly unable to support her body. Hime's arm extended just in time, encircling Phoenix.

Phoenix tried to squeeze words of gratitude from her rapid breathing but saw Hime nodding at her with a smile. Understanding, Phoenix immediately shot toward the exit like an arrow released from a bow. Several human officers tried to stop her, but were all blocked by Proxymar.

Only after Phoenix's figure disappeared did Proxymar slowly say:

"At the crossroads, they need to say goodbye."

### 5

Faster, faster...

The wide white robe restricted Phoenix's stride length, but couldn't suppress her rapid pace. The sound of canvas shoes striking the metal floor echoed through the corridor, like a countdown urging her heartbeat forward.

Several tall staff members opened their office door, nearly colliding with Phoenix. They shouted angrily at the girl's back, but Phoenix seemed deaf to their words.

"Hey, watch where you're going, blind girl!"

"Who let a kid into the base?"

"Wait, that green light is..."

Don't mind them, must hurry...

Phoenix left the corridor's hushed whispers behind. She rushed to the elevator, her fingers so stiff she couldn't feel herself pressing the down button. She watched the elevator descend from floor 13 to 10, stopping at each floor—too slow. In the next second, she turned toward the stairs. The emergency exit warning lights stretched her shadow long, breaking it at corners, only to reassemble it in the light of the next floor.

Three hundred meters? Four hundred meters?

Still not enough, still too far...

Phoenix didn't know how long she'd been running, but she felt no fatigue. Her legs remained as powerful as when she first started, even capable of running faster. The anticipated soreness and numbness never materialized. Instead, a warm current flowed from the green light in her chest, growing like vines that gently embraced her legs, giving them endless strength.

That place ahead...

Turn left.

Though she'd only walked this path once, the route was exceptionally clear in her mind. The memory of her arrival played in reverse, forming a navigation guide directing her way.

When transport machines grew more numerous around her feet, when she finally burst through the massive steel gates at the port entrance, she realized she was about to succeed.

A glance at the giant clock mounted on the wall showed she had eight minutes left.

But in this complex port, there were hundreds of docking bays for ships.

Phoenix frantically recalled all the information she'd seen on the holographic screen. Yes, the surveillance footage showed the letter C in the bottom right corner.

She raised her head anxiously, looking around, only to see a large letter display hanging overhead: "A."

There's still time.

Smart transport vehicles darting about blocked her vision, but she was absolutely certain Disar was in another direction.

"Disar—Disar—!!!"

She began running again, calling out her best friend's name loudly. Air rushed into her mouth, drying her once-moist tongue, forcing her to shout with a hoarse intensity.

"Disar—where are you—"

"Time announcement: 11:00."

The mechanical time announcement suddenly swallowed all sounds, including her calls, the noise of treads rolling over the ground, and the roar of ships taking off and landing. Phoenix hallucinated the cold, chaotic school broadcast from her dream, then recalled the scene from her nightmare where Disar wasn't by her side. A pain of impending loss and separation suddenly welled up.

Please, Disar, where are you?

"Phoenix—!"

Phoenix froze for a moment upon hearing the familiar voice, shifting her center of gravity backward to barely stop her forward momentum.

"Phoenix, I'm here—"

"Disar!"

Phoenix glimpsed that familiar figure among the passing machinery and crowds. Wearing a backpack and a tea-colored coat bearing the Alliance Army insignia, waving at her—it was Disar.

Found her, there's still time.

She walked quickly toward Disar, seeing a transport robot spraying disinfectant mist on her friend's shoes.

Disar wore a smile and spoke to the panting Phoenix in a cheerful tone, as if she hadn't just suffered the crushing of her dreams.

"Oh, Phoenix, you're awake!" Disar blinked and said, "They just told me you'd be sleeping much longer."

The disinfection robot raised its nozzle higher, spraying Disar's backpack. The disinfectant mist dispersed, forming a fleeting veil between them. Phoenix suddenly noticed a small pin on Disar's chest, like some kind of Alliance Army base souvenir.

"This isn't right..." Phoenix stumbled forward two steps, putting her hands on Disar's shoulders and looking directly into her eyes as the transport robot emitted an avoidance beep. "Something must have gone wrong..."

"Machines don't lie." Disar suddenly smiled—genuinely this time. "But since it's a result of post-natal gene mutation, it requires luck, right? Whether you are or aren't, it's purely a matter of probability."

Phoenix only then noticed how Disar's blue pupils shone brilliantly under the port's lighting, blending with the color of her own sky-blue hair tips that had risen from her running.

"At least let me return to Ceres Major with you once..." Phoenix's voice began to tremble.

"I'm afraid that's not possible. I just asked the staff who brought me here, and they said Shipsians who haven't completed their training courses can't leave the Prometheus Array." Disar extended her arm, allowing the disinfection robot to spray her upper body.

Phoenix was momentarily speechless, looking away as her hands dropped from Disar's shoulders.

Disar suddenly pointed at the screen overhead and exclaimed, "Ah, look! My ship is arriving."

Phoenix looked up to see a black ship appearing on the screen, gleaming with crystal blue light, preparing to slowly descend.

"Disar," Phoenix said, gazing at her friend's profile, "do you... hate me?"

"Hmm? Of course not. We're friends, why would I hate you?"

"We promised to become Alliance Army warriors together, but now..."

Disar smiled again, removing the pin from her slightly oversized coat and displaying it before Phoenix.

"See this? It's a credential given to me by an Alliance Army officer, engraved with a unique identification code." Disar's tone carried a hint of pride. "It's a symbol of achievement! In the future, if I apply to an Alliance-sponsored academy or enlist, this pin will give me priority admission. With my grades, getting into the Alliance Army won't be difficult—don't you believe me?"

Phoenix froze, uncertain whether to express guilt or offer congratulations.

"Besides, I told you, the emergence of Shipsians is completely probabilistic! You have nothing to feel guilty about!" Disar forcefully patted Phoenix's shoulder. "You learn your combat skills, I'll study my theory. When we turn eighteen and enlist, we'll meet again in the Alliance Army. Maybe I'll even outperform you!"

Phoenix knew Disar too well—she could hear clearly how much strain was hidden in those words.

No matter how much sunlight penetrates layered storm clouds, rain will still fall. Even the most elaborate disguise seeps through in the curve of an eye's corner or the frequency of fingers fidgeting with clothing.

She could see how Disar deliberately pressed her knees together, her left hand clutching the creases of her coat hem, even the final syllables of her sentences pitched unnaturally bright—Phoenix could even see the tiny bulge in her cheek where she was biting down on her back molars.

"Still, though I can become a warrior, knowing I'll never be able to fight like those heroes is somewhat..."

The broadcast suddenly blared with a harsh ship arrival announcement, drowning out the rest of her words.

"Disar..."

"Phoenix, I have to go now! Send me super long emails, even if you're in the Prometheus Array and I'm on Ceres Major—"

Disar suddenly jumped up and waved, her coat hem sweeping in an arc. Her eyelashes trembled in the dispersing sound waves, something moist quickly evaporating in her eyes. Nearby, a small vehicle extended a mechanical arm, pulling a security line that clicked into place on the gangway's fasteners, separating the two.

She heard the collision of the ship landing on the ground, countless promises wanting to be spoken.

Ten thousand promises crystallized in her throat, but what finally escaped was the simplest sentence.

"See you when we grow up!"

The shout struck the port's steel walls, splashing back echoes.

"Phoenix—goodbye—"

"Disar—goodbye—"

Farewells are such light things, Phoenix thought, light enough to float through cabin door cracks, light enough to be instantly vaporized by a propulsion engine's blue flames, light enough to cling to each other's clothes in silent vigil.

Phoenix watched the disappearing light on the monitor screen, suddenly realizing that the stars were guiding two specks of dust into different directions at the same crossroads. On the spiral arm of the galaxy, they were beginning journeys without each other's presence.

From this moment, the galaxy welcomed her rebirth through fire.
