## Final Score

The final score of each team in this competition is the sum of the time used in three rounds of competition. The team with a lower total time will receive a higher ranking. Considering the differences in the strength of the ship themselves and the disparities in players' ship collection, we have also introduced **penalty time** debuff and **time reduction** buff mechanisms, which means that the final scores of participants will be added or subtracted. The following is the scoring mechanism that will be used in this competition:

- The score of each round is composed of basic time and penalty time.

- **Round 1**: Buhloo, Saber, Corsair, and Naya get +10s debuff; Neni, Monsoon, Mistral, and Havoc get +5s debuff.

- **Round 2**: Photurius gets +5s debuff.

- **Round 3**: Fujin gets +10s debuff.

- **Main Weapon Challenge**: If the ship you choose **ONLY** have main weapon to make damage, you will get -15s (not include Stun EMP, Reflex EMP, Ion Cannon (Note). Considering that community missions have very few lasers, we treat Personal Shield as non damage ability).

    > The ship catalog section of this site (the "All ships" page) distinguishes between the attributes of Aura and Zen with colors. In short, if the ship you use has both a green Aura and a green Zen, then you can benefit from this time reduction bonus (Attention to exceptions below).
    >
    > **(Note)** Ulted Stun EMP, Reflex EMP, Ion Cannon will deal extra damage. If you use these types of ship, even if you never used the skill for once, you cannot have the time reduction buff. But in other words, un-ulted green skills can surely benefit the buff. (Whether offering a video of main-weapon-only run is available is still under discussion)

- If the ship you use is not fully upgraded, we will provide you with additional time reduction buffs based on the upgrading status of the ship.

    > Taking the ulted 6-6-6 ship as the benchmark, every un-ulted level will get a 1s reduction. For example, a 4-4-4 ship is 6 levels from ulted, it will receive a 6 second time reduction bonus.

- If a player fails to complete a certain mission, he will receive a corresponding penalty time based on the number of waves he didn't complete. The penalty times for each wave of the Act 1 to 6 are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 seconds respectively.

    > For example, if a player only reaches 6-3 in one mission, indicating he has failed to complete two waves in Act 6, he will get a penalty time of 30 seconds in addition to the base time. If a player forgets to play a mission, he will receive a total penalty time of 300 seconds (4*(10+11+12+13+14+15)=300).

- The final score is the total time of two members in 3 rounds, and the team with the shortest time wins the championship!

All the results will be published once we finish the statistics, our site will also publish the results by then.

## Rewards (Tentative)

We don't offer money awards in the event. For teams who get top during the event will have the chance to have a special title in the group chat.

> For example, Discord server will award the winning team a special unique two of a kind *once in a lifetime* super exclusive role: **Poo Poo Head Champion** (color to be chosen by winners).
