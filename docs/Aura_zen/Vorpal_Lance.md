## Comments

- Editor: It's useless to hide behind, bro.
- ☀🐕: With both offensive and defensive capabilities, VL really is the best all-round Aura, boasting extreme effectiveness against crowded groups of enemies. Though not as good when soloing high HP enemies. And grinding for RNG is somewhat frustrating.
- Hank: An ult VL is a Sudden Spurt of a Salted Fish!

## APEX 3: Trident

> Editor: Nicely put, it's called a trident; not so nicely, it's a pee fork.

The bonus of this APEX is sometimes a form of negative optimization. Although the lance itself is divided into three branches and shot in three directions, covering a larger area, the cost is that the damage on each branch is reduced to one-third. The most direct consequence is that a single lance cannot eliminate raven unless the lance is used at close range. The total damage of two of the three lance branches is 26.4, while the unprotected raven have 27 health points. In other words, you either need to use the main weapon for follow-up attacks or use another lance, both of which require additional actions.

Its advantage lies in being able to more efficiently deal with sparrow swarms because one lance is enough to eliminate any type of sparrow. According to the coverage area of the trident, usually only two lances are needed to clear the vast majority of sparrows, while the remaining sparrows need to be dealt with using the main weapon or Zen. A wider range means more bullets can be cleared; a single trident can clear out a considerable safe area, thereby increasing survivability. However, these advantages cannot make up for the lack of damage. When facing attacks from heavier waves, you will have to consider the consequences of damage dispersion. When you need to get close to ensure that the invaders take full damage from the lance, it invisibly increases your number of actions. Therefore, for those players whose basic skills with the lance are not very solid, it is best to avoid this APEX altogether or simply use the base form.
