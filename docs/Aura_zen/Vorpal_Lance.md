<img src="/terms/vl.png" style={{zoom:1.25}}/>

Easy and straightforward to use offensive Aura. Easily recommendable for all players. Potential to deal devastating damage when utilized to maximum effect. Slightly annoying at times due to RNG at play, plays quite a big factor when speedrunning. Very meta in daily missions.

The details of this skill are listed as follows:

| Level    | 1    | 2     | 3    | 4     | 5    | Ultimate |
| -------- | ---- | ----- | ---- | ----- | ---- | -------- |
| Damage   | 33   | 34.65 | 36.3 | 37.95 | 39.6 | 39.6     |
| Counters | 2    | 3     | 3    | 4     | 4    | 4        |

- Ultimate: Allows the fired VL projectile itself to clear bullets as it travels forward.
- Score: 9.18 / 10
- Useful Levels: 2, 5, (sometimes Ult)
- Priority Level: 2 / 8

## Comments

- Editor: It's useless to hide behind, bro.
- ‚òÄüêï: With both offensive and defensive capabilities, VL really is the best all-round Aura, boasting extreme effectiveness against crowded groups of enemies. Though not as good when soloing high HP enemies. And grinding for RNG is somewhat frustrating.
- Hank: An ult VL is a Sudden Spurt of a Salted Fish!

## Usage

Despite being of priority level 2, it is extremely important to upgrade VL to level 2 first before upgrading the Zen further beyond level 1 if it is an AP ship. This not only adds an additional counter to VL, but the upgrade means a VL can instantly kill any affinity of Ravens, which is extremely valuable, especially when crowds of Ravens can be very common. The utility of VL is about the same for Level 2 and onwards.

VL is generally very straightforward in usage. See a column of several invaders? Yeah, just throw in a VL. Basically, use it opportunistically. However, do not hesitate to use it. You do not need to wait for a perfect line-up to use VL. So long there are more than 3 invaders in that line (if Ravens are present), you can throw a VL already. Do not wait for Sparrows to line up as there is no point since they can easily escape your VL due to their rapid movement and their small size. In fact, don't use VL on Sparrows unless the wave is purely Sparrows. You do not need to wait for the larger upfield invaders to arrive before you start throwing VLs at the Ravens and Sparrows in front. Generally do not use VLs on larger invaders like Herons unless there are several other invaders behind it, unless there is not much in the wave other than these larger invaders. As a general guide, using 2 VLs in Act 4 and above per wave is fine. As an offensive Aura, it is your job to keep the field clean before the invaders can overwhelm you.

If there are too many Ravens on field at once (4 columns of them) and you have 3 or more VLs, you can perform a lance sweep, simply throwing VLs out at equally spaced horizontal distances to eliminate as much as you can. It is usually not sensible to throw away 4 VLs in a single wave, unless all the Ravens are hiding behind a Vulture (or 2 Eagles). 3 VLs are usually enough to eliminate most of the threat.

VL is an absolute pleasure to use in very dense waves. It is in fact the most powerful offensive aura in daily missions. Once you see such waves, you can happily throw down 3 - 4 VLs, spread out evenly from left to right, and poof, pretty much everything is gone. Even for dense and heavy waves, the size of larger invaders make them very vulnerable to multiple VLs, making them very weak or completely obliterating them. The huge size of an Eagle for example, will usually eat at least 2 VLs, when 3 VLs is sufficient to take it down. VLs should not be stockpiled during dense or heavy waves, but exhausted to the point where at least one side of the field is almost clear of all invaders (leaving either only 1 Raven or some Sparrows). For light waves, a maximum of 2 VLs should be used, while it is recommended to use 1 unless you don't have enough spare particles on field and are running low on VL supply. This is to get rid of one side of the light wave to allow you to collect particles leftover from a dense and/or heavy wave.

Due to the fact that VL can reach upfield invaders hiding behind other invaders, it is extremely useful is reducing the threat very efficiently, particularly when crowds of Ravens behind can quickly overwhelm you with so many turrets. Upfield larger invaders can also be disarmed easily by sniping out their dangerous turrets, such as those on Eagles and Vultures.

For certain ships, where the main weapon is not a very good turret popper, VL is able to make up for that function. Furthermore, this function does not interfere very much with its Raven clearing capabilities since it is still likely that you will be able to catch invaders behind even though you specifically target the turret on an invader Eagle or larger. This function is very useful especially on upfield Eagles with deadly middle turrets as well. However, it takes more than 1 VL to pop off a turret on an armor Vulture. It takes only 1 VL to take out a turret on a Shielded invader though, of course, after the shield is downed. It is suggested you use 1 VL and then finish off the turret with your main unless you are extremely desperate to get rid of it.

The less known useful feature about VL is Vorpal Wake. Do not underestimate its utility. It is very useful for ships that do not have a defensive Zen. Similar to riding up an ML to take advantage of its bullet capabilities, you can do the same with VL. However, you usually do not push up beyond 1/3 of the vertical screen space as the width of bullet clearing is quite small. There are cases, however, where pushing up all the way upfield is beneficial in order to collect more particles for more VLs. Take note that this is extremely dangerous and only recommended when speedrunning. For normal usage, this function is generally not used much, but it is possible to time the VL to clear bullets which are milliseconds away from hitting you and also catch multiple invaders in that VL. It is not recommended and you generally should not be using VL for clearing bullets unless you lack a defensive Zen as VLs are meant to be used pre-emptively, and not as a last resort.
