> Quickly kill all targets within range.

A hybrid between MS and LS, it can be described as a fast damage disposing version of LS at times, since the targeting of Blade Storm can be quite random, just like LS. 

The details of this skill are listed as follows:

| Level      | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | Ultimate |
| ---------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | -------- |
| Max Damage | 80   | 84   | 88   | 92   | 96   | 100      |
| Max Radius | 350  | 375  | 400  | 425  | 450  | 500      |

- Ultimate: Includes Omnislash, which increases the number of hits from 10 hits to 20 hits, which means less overkill of targets.
- Score: 8.36 / 10
- Useful Levels: None in particular
- Priority Level: 2 / 8

## Comments

- Editor: The smooth flow of a warrior can turn into sloppiness if you are not careful.
- ‚òÄüêï: As the exclusive Aura of one of the best meta ships in the game, let‚Äôs take a look at the description text of its ult-upgrade. It says, ‚ÄúBS deals double damage‚Äù (likely an in-game Chinese translation error). Like what the actual heck it‚Äôs literally a fraud. Because in reality it simply doubles the number of targets while maintaining the total damage. Here‚Äôs my humble opinion. Since Shogun is already one of the most powerful ships, let‚Äôs make it THE most powerful. Let‚Äôs make BS do AP damage on the ult-upgrade, and make the original ult-upgrade effect to be available at level 1. As you‚Äôve probably noticed the fact that Shogun clears Unprotected missions faster than Armored missions which is rather illogical. Therefore, a buff like this makes Shogun clear Armored missions even faster because Armored enemies have less HP, with only difference being the lack of 9 REMP damage dealt compared to Unprotected foes.

## Usage

The usage of Blade Storm is very simple. As long as the invader enters your range, just use the skill on them. Blade Storm is about quick kill. It does not have the annoying circling of missiles swarm, so it can be used continuously.

Generally speaking, the usage of Blade Storm basically involves the overall usage of Shogun. I will introduce it in detail in its Cookbook. Blade Storm can be concluded as a damage spam or a full defense. When faced with a dense group of invaders, a Blade Storm usually requires the use of Reflex EMP to complete a round of attack, or multiple Blade Storms can be used continuously when there is a large amount of energy on the field. This is done considering that the maximum damage of a single Blade Storm is only 100, so its effectiveness needs to be maximized.

One fact about the Blade Storm is that if the invader leaves the range during the attack, the Blade Storm will no longer deal damage to that invader, which is different from the Missile Swarm. Therefore, when attacking, you need to ensure that the invader is within range before attacking. Another little-known fact is that if an invader in a certain direction is killed by Blade Storm or main, the remaining damage will be shot up instead of being distributed to other targets. Therefore, when facing a large number of invaders, 100 points of damage may not be enough. This is because the damage value distributed to each target is fixed when the invader is first targeted at.

In view of these features, when using the Blade Storm, you need to always pay attention to the number of invaders and ensure that the invaders are within the attack range. If the invaders are nearly be killed, the right size of aura is important. If the aura's damage is just enough to kill the invader, it is very likely that all invaders will explode at the same time at the last moment.

Finally, it should be noted that the feature of the Shogun is grazing, so if you want to release its fullest potential, you need to calm down and train your grazing skills, especially the technique of grazing MIRVs.
