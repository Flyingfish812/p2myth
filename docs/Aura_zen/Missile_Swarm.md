## Comments

- Editor: The missile's circling pattern is programmed, and I don't want it either.
- ☀🐕: An extremely potent Aura. Although a slight problem would be that some missiles go around targets like sparrows or the front row turrets of condors and rocs instead of hitting them straight away, which delays the deployment time of the next batch of missiles. A potential solution would be that if the number of remaining missiles flying around is below a certain threshold, the next round of missiles is allowed to be deployed. Upon MS activation, the remaining flying missiles from last MS are instantly voided. A change like this doesn’t go against the intended mechanics of MS, instead making it more user-friendly. Because it significantly reduces the chance of failed barreling since it’s okay if a few missiles miss their targets.
- Hank: When will you be able to be stable and stop circling, and I will have no regrets in my life.
