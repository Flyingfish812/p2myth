Consistent burst damage Aura. Easy to pick up, hard to master. Generally reliable. Useful even for intermediate players who have moved on from a defensive playstyle. High level optimization is possible.

- Ultimate: Allows the missiles to re-target another target if the original turret or invader (that each individual missile decided at the moment MS was launched) is dead. Bear in mind it will not re-target another target that MS did not lock onto at the time MS was launched.

## Comments

- Editor: The missile's circling pattern is programmed, and I don't want it either.
- ‚òÄüêï: An extremely potent Aura. Although a slight problem would be that some missiles go around targets like sparrows or the front row turrets of condors and rocs instead of hitting them straight away, which delays the deployment time of the next batch of missiles. A potential solution would be that if the number of remaining missiles flying around is below a certain threshold, the next round of missiles is allowed to be deployed. Upon MS activation, the remaining flying missiles from last MS are instantly voided. A change like this doesn‚Äôt go against the intended mechanics of MS, instead making it more user-friendly. Because it significantly reduces the chance of failed barreling since it‚Äôs okay if a few missiles miss their targets.
- Hank: When will you be able to be stable and stop circling, and I will have no regrets in my life.

## Usage

Missile Swarm is one of the most straightforward offensive Auras to use in the game. It has the Fire and Forget principle, where after you launch it, you simply trust it to do its job and you continue doing whatever you need to. There generally isn't much of a point for you to care about what MS does after you fire it. This is because the job is on you to make sure MS targets whatever you need to target before you actually fire it. This means that it is important that you try to as upfield as possible so that you cover as many targets as possible. After a while, with experience from using MS, you'll roughly know how many targets are sufficient for different sizes of Aura so that you don't waste missiles. This is the part that is hard to master, and can make all the difference in speedrunning.

The ult isn't terribly important for MS, as misguided missiles that attempt to hit a target that has already been destroyed actually have a chance of simply trailing off to hit another invader, especially larger invaders. The ult helps MS when there are crowds of many invaders. When there are larger invaders in front, the ult doesn't really help.

The only other strategy for MS is to generally be on one side of the field when you fire it, then after firing it, quickly strafe to the other side. This has 2 advantages. Firstly, it allows you to dodge the initial oncoming fire since tracking turrets will all fire to that side. The other advantage is MS tends to be like an epidemic; it's damage tends to spread out from the epicenter, and slowly gets weaker as the radius spreads. This means that staying on that side means your main weapon will compete for damage with MS. With ult, this is less significant as the missiles can redirect themselves, but the more implication is that due to the high burst damage of MS, this can mean straight fire weapons can have nothing left to hit since MS is a burst damage which kills whatever is on the side you fire MS on extremely fast. This second advantage is what i call Divide and Conquer, where MS takes care of one side of invaders while your main weapon takes care of the other side.

The very high burst damage of MS means that it is very effective against front crowds of invaders. However, since it spreads from its source of release, this means more often than not, it is difficult to reach the crowd of invaders upfield. This can be overcomed by some MS ships that can reach upfield safely, especially with TP, making this not such a huge issue. Even with large invaders in front, the heavy damage caused by MS is able to eliminate these large invaders quite quickly so that you can quickly disperse of the invaders behind as well.

Another problem of MS is its slight RNG factor. Despite being bursty, it can sometimes be difficult to launch consecutive MS strikes, especially when the crowd in front dies out very fast and you must quickly get rid of the particles you collected. This is because you may only fire the next MS after the last missile has hit its intended target, accounting for re-targeting. (Missiles that are lost due to all targets locked on at fire time already destroyed do not count) This means that you are sometimes at the mercy of the targeting system which may not correctly assign the missiles to their targets, causing a lot of re-targeting. This time delay is usually quite minimal as missiles travel quite fast.

As the next MS burst can only be fired after a while, this can become a huge issue in very dense waves. As all the small invaders in front get wiped out so quickly while the rest of the missiles struggle to reach the other targets, you would have eaten up too many particles and overfilled your Aura, wasting particles. Despite the high raw damage being dished out quickly, it is still not quick enough in such dense waves. The fact that it deals raw damage instead of AoE damage, and taking into account the travel time of all the missiles, MS can be slow in clearing out all these dense waves, making it difficult to use in such waves. However, accompanied with a strong defensive Zen such as TP, MS can still see some usage in the highest rank Marshal. For most purposes however, in Commander rank and below, MS still possess sufficient power to plow through invaders fast enough before the field gets horribly messy, since dense waves in lower ranks don't pump tons of bullets onto the field at once. In heavy waves particularly, which can be very problematic for most players, MS has the firepower to plow through these large invaders quickly enough before the second round of spinners go off again with too much other interference.

The final problem of MS is it is unreliable in turret popping due to the random serving nature of MS that often hits the hull of invaders instead of the turret itself. However, this is often not too much of an issue unless you have the larger invaders in front which may be a slight issue due to how much burst damage MS does. The principle is thus to kill the entire invader before it even has the chance to flood the field with bullets and lasers. This does become an issue with boss invaders such as Condors and Rocs, especially when MS is a one time use. Being unable to pop turrets means MS is nothing more than a damage tool which simply makes the fight slightly faster without being able to aid you in the rest of the fight with so many turrets still up and firing.
