Basically a mini Aurora Nuke. Slow moving straight firing projectile which is difficult to use. Very limited turret popping ability since the impact damage is very small. Generally good for concentrated areas of Ravens and Sparrows.

The details of this skill are listed as follows:

| Level         | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | Ultimate |
| ------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | -------- |
| Impact Damage | 10   | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~        |
| Blast Damage  | 20   | 21   | 22   | 23   | 24   | 24       |
| Counters      | 2    | 3    | 3    | 4    | 4    | 4        |

- Ultimate: Increases the blast radius to 115% of the original radius.
- Score: 6.36 / 10

## Comments

- Editor: Envy it, you trade it for speed.
- ☀🐕: The ult-upgrade on GM is quite perfunctory. I reckon it’s a sensible idea to make it do BEMP on the ult-upgrade to match that of the VL, in order to make it more viable across different mission types. Disintegrator Warhead Apex therefore grants GM extended BEMP range. To make things worse, the AOE damage is kind of awkward because it’s below 30 which is like the standard amount of AOE damage in this game, for instance, MB, High Damage REMP and TP Explosive Arrival. Please buff it to 30.
- Hank: Believe me, it’s really fun to play it under specific missions.

## APEX 1: Disintergrator Warhead

- Game Description: Destroys enemy bullets caught in the blast.
- Numeric Interpretation: Clears all the bullets within the blast radius of about 150.
- Score: 3.82 / 5
- Ships with the APEX: Banshee (Phi), Claymore (Lambda), Mistral (Tau)

> Editor: The art of explosion lies in exploiting all value before clearing everything away.

## APEX 2: Tungsten Warhead

- Game Description: The Tungsten Goliath Missile pierces armor and deals more damage.
- Numeric Interpretation: The missiles ignore 30% damage reduction of armors.
- Score: 3.82 / 5
- Ships with the APEX: Centurion (Tau)

> Editor: Whether it can eliminate ravens in one shot is the standard for measuring the effectiveness of area damage.

The bonus of this APEX brings about a qualitative change because in armored stages, the health of ravens is 24, and the area damage of the Goliath Missile happens to be 24. In other words, one missile can clear out an area of armored ravens. This also makes speedrun possible because the release of the Goliath Missile can be considered instantaneous, and skipping a few ravens can save a lot of time.

## APEX 3: High Capacity

- Game Description: Allows the ship to store an additional Goliath Missile.
- Numeric Interpretation: The max volume increases from 4 to 5.
- Score: 2.27 / 5
- Ships with the APEX: Starless (Epsilon)

> Editor: Once again, holding back from shooting, you've got a bit of a problem.

Similar to the high-capacity APEX for Vorpal Lances, the demand for the Goliath missile for this APEX is not very high either. As a skill with area damage, the principle is to use it immediately when necessary. Holding onto missiles means your time will be wasted only using the main cannon and Zen against invaders. The only scenario where it might be useful is when facing four eagles appearing together or a group of heavier enemies, where you can unleash all the missiles at once for a burst of damage. But most of the time, four missiles are sufficient.

## APEX 4: Proximity Detonator

- Game Description: Detonates when an Invader is nearby.
- Numeric Interpretation: The missile will explode when it is within 50 units of an Invader.
- Score: 1.55 / 5
- Ships with the APEX: Monsoon (Gamma)

> Editor: I don't know why, but I'm reminded of certain *Makeinu* female characters who explode with just a little touch.

The bonus of this APEX is somewhat redundant. As a player of Goliath Missile, aiming accurately at the position is crucial, and sometimes even the slightest deviation is unacceptable. It can be said that hitting the missile accurately is a basic skill requirement. While this APEX ostensibly increases the margin of error, it also prevents more precise targeting. More precise targeting can be achieved through muscle memory training, which means your money can be saved to purchase more cost-effective APEXs.
