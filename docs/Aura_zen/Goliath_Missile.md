# Goliath Missile

> Fires a slow, large-area explosive missile.

<img src="/terms/gm.png" style={{zoom:0.85}}/>

Basically a mini Aurora Nuke. Slow moving straight firing projectile which is difficult to use. Very limited turret popping ability since the impact damage is very small. Generally good for concentrated areas of Ravens and Sparrows.

The details of this skill are listed as follows:

| Level         | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | Ultimate |
| ------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | -------- |
| Impact Damage | 10   | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~        |
| Blast Damage  | 20   | 21   | 22   | 23   | 24   | 24       |
| Counters      | 2    | 3    | 3    | 4    | 4    | 4        |

- Ultimate: Increases the blast radius to 115% of the original radius.
- Score: 6.36 / 10
- Useful Levels: Ult
- Priority Level: 6 / 8

## Comments

- Editor: Envy it, you trade it for speed.
- ‚òÄüêï: The ult-upgrade on GM is quite perfunctory. I reckon it‚Äôs a sensible idea to make it do BEMP on the ult-upgrade to match that of the VL, in order to make it more viable across different mission types. Disintegrator Warhead Apex therefore grants GM extended BEMP range. To make things worse, the AOE damage is kind of awkward because it‚Äôs below 30 which is like the standard amount of AOE damage in this game, for instance, MB, High Damage REMP and TP Explosive Arrival. Please buff it to 30.
- Hank: Believe me, it‚Äôs really fun to play it under specific missions.

## Usage

A level 1 GM is pretty much useless since the blast radius is small which makes it very prone to RNG and very difficult to aim properly to affect a reasonable number of invaders. Coupled with the fact that it takes 2 GMs to kill a Raven, having only 2 GMs at hand is pretty much only useful for eliminating that small cluster of 1-3 Ravens. And then you are stuck with eliminating the rest of the crowd yourself.

GM only becomes usable at its ult level where the blast damage is increased and the radius is bigger. Now you are able to catch more Ravens and deal considerable damage to larger invaders.

As GMs are very slow moving, they must be pre-empted. This means that they must be fired when the last invader of the previous wave has been destroyed, unless the wave has a frontline Vulture or frontline Condor. This is particularly true for light waves as it is very easy for invaders to simply dodge your GMs. It is also true for dense waves as a pre-fired GM can penetrate deep into the invader lines and explode in the mid lines, causing the blast damage to be dealt to both the most upfield invaders and the frontline invaders. As GM is offensive, all its counters (since 4 isn't terribly a lot) should be exhausted. It is recommended to fire 2 on each side. Generally because you want to quickly sweep from left to right to cover both sides, the 2 GMs on each side are slightly spaced apart horizontally. On a light wave however, generally only 2 should be used to conserve for a dense and/or heavy wave. If you are getting replenishment stocks of GMs midwave, if it is a dense wave, you may opt to fire more GMs to speed up the clearing process.

Unfortunately, since GMs are very slow moving, they are very prone to missing, or otherwise, very prone to be intercepted by Sparrows. This can be incredibly annoying since the impact damage would be wasted on these little invaders that would be severely overkilled. In fact, it would be nice if you could aim GMs at Herons and above since 2 GM blasts will take out a Raven, but generally it's fine to allow it to hit Ravens. Firing GMs early would minimize the chances of frontline Sparrows intercepting the GMs. In pure Sparrow waves, firing 1 or 2 GMs is also a good idea, particularly in higher ranks where dart streamer Sparrows become incredibly annoying. Just hope and pray for these waves as there is a chance all these Sparrows would just dodge the GM you fire...sigh...
