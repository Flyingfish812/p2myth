# Barrier

> Deploy a barrier to block bullets and lasers.

<img src="/terms/barrier.png" style={{zoom:1.25}}/>

A pre-emptive usage Aura. Only recommended after a player has mastered the basics of understanding how bullets and lasers work. Surprisingly very effective if wielded very well.

The details of this skill are listed as follows:

| Level                    | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | Ultimate |
| ------------------------ | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | -------- |
| Max Barrier Strength (%) | 100  | 126  | 150  | 176  | 200  | 200      |
| Max Radius               | 250  | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~        |

- Ultimate: Adds an additional Inner Lining, a smaller barrier inside of the outer barrier that has approximately a maximum of 100% strength. However, the inner lining will fade together with the outer lining if the outer lining starts fading first.
- Score: 6.00 / 10
- Useful Levels: 1, (sometimes 5), Ult
- Priority Level: 2 / 8

## Comments

- Editor: You want to use it to block something?
- ☀🐕: Barrier is too weak of an Aura without a Reflector Apex. Inner Lining should be made to be able to persist if the outer Barrier is destroyed first. And, a durability buff is always welcomed.

## APEX 1: Reflector

- Game Description: Laser reflect on the Barrier outer surface.
- Numeric Interpretation: Laser will be reflected to invaders with 10 damage per second.
- Score: 4.45 / 5
- Ships with the APEX: Gorthaur (Beta), Heechi (Delta), Qhelqod (Gamma), Stinger (Epsilon), Tillat'Or (Gamma)

> Editor: Inside the circle and outside the circle are simply two different worlds.

This apex causes any lasers that hit the outer edge of the outer barrier to reflect back to a random target, with a DPS of 20, similar to PS's Laser Reflection ult. Bear in mind that even though lasers are reflected, the barriers will still take damage from the lasers per normal, and the inner lining will also still fade as per normal if the outer barrier dies first.

## APEX 2: Reinforced Lining

- Game Description: Increases strength of Inner Lining.
- Numeric Interpretation: The inner lining of the barrier will have the same strength as the outer lining.
- Score: 1.91 / 5

> Editor: Think about who you want to trap inside the circle.
