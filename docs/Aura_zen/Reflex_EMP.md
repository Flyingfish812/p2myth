<img src="/terms/REMP.png" style={{zoom:1.25}}/>

One of the hardest defensive Zens to use. A versatile defense and offense tool once ult. Slow cooldown means it is difficult to grasp the appropriate interval between use, thus only recommended for pro players. The concept of leaving yourself exposed to incoming fire even for a short while is also not intuitive for lower skilled players.

The details of this skill are listed as follows:

| Level                    | 1          | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | Ultimate |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | -------- |
| Radius                   | 225        | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~        |
| Charging Duration (s)    | 1.0        | 0.9  | 0.8  | 0.7  | 0.6  | 0.6      |
| Charge Time Increase (s) | 3.0        | 2.75 | 2.5  | 2.25 | 2    | 2        |
| Charge Time Recovery (s) | Slow (6.5) | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~        |

There is a very small chance that REMP will not be able to eliminate the pellets released by MIRV Deathonators, if the REMP is released too early as shown below in slow motion:

## APEX 3: Serenity

- Game Description: Reflex EMP is triggered manually with increased range.
- Numeric Interpretation: The max range increases from 225 to 280, but you need another click to activate it.
- Score: 1.55 / 5
- Ships with the APEX: Yigothu (Omega)

> Editor: Switching from automatic transmission to manual transmission, anyone who has been to driving school knows how difficult it can be.

Building upon the extended range, this APEX allows the Reflex EMP to be manually triggered like a Mega Bomb. This is essentially a negative addition because manual triggering requires more operations, unlike the original Reflex EMP which only requires finding the right position and releasing to reflect. In critical situations, increased operations bring greater risks. For Yigothu, this APEX is completely unnecessary because the Chrono Field itself provides sufficient defense; there is simply no need to suffer the disadvantage of manual triggering for a little extra reflection range.
