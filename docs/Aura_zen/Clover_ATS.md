Much like the Focus Lance, it acts as a free DPS as long as it's used actively after the cooldown.

The details of this skill are listed as follows:

## Comments

- Editor: The faster it is, the larger the circle will be formed.
- ☀🐕: I honestly have no idea how the devs have come up with this abstract idea of flying crap. I feel like it’d still be underwhelming even if it deals twice the damage. It’s so crap that it misses sparrows frequently let alone it deals excessive damage to them. It’s literally unredeemable, please do over.
- 圆锥曲线: The people who designed this are probably rebels.
- No2oMe: Fine, I get that Missile Swarm spins around, but why the hell does this stupid thing spin too?!

## Usage

The problem of this Zen is very big. A total of 72 damage points are distributed to four missiles, which is 18 damage per missile. When used on a sparrow, there will be a lot of damage overflow, but it is not enough to destroy a raven. The two missiles destroy the raven and cause overflow damage. So a general tip is to just use it however you want as long as it's not used to attack sparrows, except in the first act.

Since there are more sparrows in the first act, the missiles can be used to kill a wave of sparrows, while the main gun can be used to kill ravens and herons. But starting from the second act, as the density of invaders increases, missiles should be used more to hit larger invaders. This is necessary to avoid damage overflow.

Like the Missile Swarm, the Clover ATS still has the problem of missiles circling, and the radius of its circle is larger. Therefore it is not recommended to use this Zen in the middle of a group of invaders, especially a less dense one. The more recommended approach is to charge at the bottom of the screen to make the missile fly as straight as possible and hit the target. At the same time, use this Zen as often as possible, it's one of the few ways to exploit its value.

## APEX 1: Shield Breaker

- Game Description: Adds missiles carrying warheads that deal extra damage to shields.
- Numeric Interpretation: Missiles deal 2.5x damage to shields.
- Score: 2.91 / 5
- Ships with the APEX: Naya (Phi)

> Editor: The need for Shield Breaker is constant.

For an APEX with a total damage of 72, the Shield Breaker APEX allows it to deal up to 180 damage to shields. In fact, the issue is that you rarely have the opportunity to use it twice in a row on the same shield. For most invaders, one round of missiles is enough to break the shield and allow you to fully utilize the power of the main weapon. However, for the roc, even if you eliminate 180 of the 405 shield with missiles, you won't have the chance to use it again because your main weapon can completely output the remaining damage during this time. Plus, with only four missiles, its effectiveness is limited. But as the saying goes, it's better than nothing.

## APEX 2: Ion Warheads

- Game Description: Adds missiles carrying Ion charges that stun turrets on impact.
- Numeric Interpretation: Missiles stun the turrets within 50 range for 0.6s.
- Score: 1.73 / 5
- Ships with the APEX: Esperon (Sigma)

> Editor: It's just a reset of the turrets.

Compared to the total of 46 missiles from the Missile Swarm, only having 4 missiles seems quite pathetic. With the same stun duration and radius, the Clover ATS can only briefly reset certain turrets instead of continuously and extensively stunning invader turrets like the Missile Swarm does. In terms of quantity, the stun bonus it brings is simply negligible.

## APEX 3: Double Clover

- Game Description: Launch twice the amount of missiles.
- Numeric Interpretation: Shoot 8 missiles with half of the original damage.
- Score: 2.36 / 5
- Ships with the APEX: Pandora (Lambda)

> Editor: The total damage of the Double Clover remains unchanged, but its damage distribution is more reasonable.

This comment, generated by the editor AI based on the content of this page, makes a lot of sense. A missile dealing 18 damage is a very awkward number; it doesn't kill ravens on the upper end and suffers from serious damage overflow when dealing with sparrows. Splitting it into 8 missiles with 9 damage each can alleviate the issue of damage overflow. In this scenario, three missiles are just enough to eliminate raven, and one missile to eliminate sparrows without causing excessive damage overflow. This APEX even made me think that its original design should have been like this.
