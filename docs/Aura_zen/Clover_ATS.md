Much like the Focus Lance, it acts as a free DPS as long as it's used actively after the cooldown.

The details of this skill are listed as follows:

| Level                    | 1          | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | Ultimate |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | -------- |
| Damage                   | 72         | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~        |
| Charging Duration (s)    | 0.9        | 0.85 | 0.8  | 0.75 | 0.7  | 0.7      |

## Comments

- Editor: The faster it is, the larger the circle will be formed.
- ‚òÄüêï: I honestly have no idea how the devs have come up with this abstract idea of flying crap. I feel like it‚Äôd still be underwhelming even if it deals twice the damage. It‚Äôs so crap that it misses sparrows frequently let alone it deals excessive damage to them. It‚Äôs literally unredeemable, please do over.
- ÂúÜÈî•Êõ≤Á∫ø: The people who designed this are probably rebels.

## Usage

The problem of this Zen is very big. A total of 72 damage points are distributed to four missiles, which is 18 damage per missile. When used on a sparrow, there will be a lot of damage overflow, but it is not enough to destroy a raven. The two missiles destroy the raven and cause overflow damage. So a general tip is to just use it however you want as long as it's not used to attack sparrows, except in the first act.

Since there are more sparrows in the first act, the missiles can be used to kill a wave of sparrows, while the main gun can be used to kill ravens and herons. But starting from the second act, as the density of invaders increases, missiles should be used more to hit larger invaders. This is necessary to avoid damage overflow.

Like the Missile Swarm, the Clover ATS still has the problem of missiles circling, and the radius of its circle is larger. Therefore it is not recommended to use this Zen in the middle of a group of invaders, especially a less dense one. The more recommended approach is to charge at the bottom of the screen to make the missile fly as straight as possible and hit the target. At the same time, use this Zen as often as possible, it's one of the few ways to exploit its value.
