> Editor: It's mostly useless; I can't think of much to comment on.

As an APEX that only increases range, its improvement is too limited. The fact is, you don't need this extra 50 radius to stun more enemies; you can compensate for it through your actions (translate: don't always rely on releasing your aura at the bottom). The only thing that might be slightly helpful to you is that the expansion speed of the radius will be a bit faster, but this won't make a big difference either.

## APEX 3: Strong Stun

- Game Description: EMP is optimized for critical systems of Invaders to increase the stun duration.
- Numeric Interpretation: The max stun time increases from 3s to 4s.
- Score: 1.73 / 5
- Ships with the APEX: Mist Star (Lambda)

> Editor: Huh? Why do I need an extra second of stun?

An extra second of stun simply means an extra round of main weapon output, nothing more. Its improvement is also very limited; you can't expect much difference just from an extra round of main weapon output. For very dense waves, one round of main weapon can at most kill a raven, and then you are surrounded by bullets. Overall, it's still a marginal improvement at best.
