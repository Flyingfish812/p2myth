The best beginner's tool of survival. Can be used offensively to some extent, but mostly defensive.

The details of this skill are listed as follows:

| Level      | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | Ultimate |
| ---------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | -------- |
| Max Radius | 250  | 300  | 350  | 400  | 450  | 450      |

- Ultimate: Stuns turrets in its radius for a maximum of 0.6s.
- Score: 8.36 / 10
- Useful Levels: All, Especially Ult
- Priority Level: 4 / 8

## Comments

- Editor: Just stop wasting efforts, shurikens.
- ‚òÄüêï: Default BEMP should be made to deal 10 damage since it‚Äôs not a powerful Aura anyway. A buff like this will make Aurora more playable. Destructive Wave Apex should be made to deal higher damage accordingly.

## Usage

Arguably, BEMP is probably the most useful Aura even at Level 1. It is thus usually recommended to upgrade your Zen first if a ship has BEMP. An upgrade in BEMP only increases it's maximum size. The smallest BEMPs can save you from death. This is coupled with the fact that the automatic regeneration of BEMP is enough for it to be used again. Since you would be usually cornered by bullets before your supposed death, the proximity with the bullets as you retreat is close enough for you to graze off them, and thus increase BEMP radius a bit more, and being a bit more useful in clearing a small enough space to wiggle your way out of tight situations. Used in small amounts, BEMP is almost able to infinitely save your life if you are more of a dodger that can dodge your way out of a bullet hell. BEMP becomes more of a second chance, which you can almost infinitely abuse at times.

Upgrading BEMP level by level does have a noticeable effect however, as the radius of BEMP increases faster even with the same amount of particles. At lower levels, BEMP is purely a defensive tool. With higher levels however, BEMP becomes more than that. It is also a re-positioning tool for offensive ships equipped with BEMP. Indirectly, BEMP helps out in damaging invaders since you can then aim your weapon straight at the invaders instead of potentially missing and wasting DPS.

BEMP is a universal bullet clearing tool, it doesn't quite have a weakness to any type of bullets, except for maybe boomerangs since mis-firing BEMP at the wrong time can miss a few incoming boomerangs. It is usually very powerful against pellet and dart spinners since you would rapidly graze off them, resulting in Aura gains and being able to hop across lanes after a very short time to avoid other bullets coming in that lane you are in. One weakness of BEMP is that it is a one-time usage, expanding it leaves you vulnerable in the next round of bullets. However, destroying invaders fast enough gives you particles to refill BEMP very quickly, thus being able to launch more decently sized BEMPs. Remember, the smallest BEMPs help!

The Ult is a game changer for BEMP. A 0.6s stun duration doesn't seem like much, but the duration is not what you are looking at. It is the very fact it stuns in the first place that works so well. This works to reset deadly spinners, MIRV Bloomers, lasers and DD Weapons, and delay them from firing, leaving you more space to move around with less bullets being pumped onto the field, or lasers to cut you off into a corner. This allows you to buy more time for you to destroy them. The huge radius also allows you to go on the offense and line yourself up with these dangerous turrets to take them out quickly. The additional useful fact of BEMP is that it slows down time briefly when the Aura is expanded (the bigger Aura, the more slowed time you have, obviously), allowing you to move yourself in place. Alternatively, the stun time can be enough for you to charge up an offensive Zen. Bear in mind that it is mostly a one time reset, so you still need to act fast to take out these turrets, unless there are enough smaller invaders around to feed your Aura. This turns BEMP into a versatile offence and defence tool.

It is much better to use BEMP pre-emptively, instead of doing the standard retreat until you are cornered strategy. This is because BEMP is a 360¬∞ Aura, and using it further back wastes the 180¬∞ behind you, clearing less bullets than optimal. When you know that you are going to be cornered, use BEMP immediately. When you have decided it is time to use BEMP, try your best to make a sudden jerk forward as much as you can (be careful not to crash into bullets, do however much you are comfortable with) and then fire BEMP. Using it as forward as you can also allows you retreat space afterwards, which is always useful.

Unfortunately, BEMP also comes with its disadvantages. For one, it could not directly deal against lasers. The reset only works one time most of the time since the second BEMP would usually not be big enough to cover all lasers on field. This means a problem against fast tracking lasers, and there can be multiple of them scattered in different parts of the playing field. The reset also works to your disadvantage for certain turrets. For T1 and T2 dart tracking turrets, it can cause them to shoot randomly after they are being free of the stun, causing a mess of bullets on field. Couple that with T3 and T4 dart tracking turrets that also flood the field again quickly, it can sometimes be a problem. The same goes with pellet spread turrets, particularly when they are hit with your BEMP during their cooldown period. However, since pellets take some time to reach you, and T1 and T2 dart turrets are not too dangerous in bullet flooding, it is usually not too much of an issue. The biggest issue comes with boomerang turrets, particularly high tier ones, since they will flood you with boomerangs immediately after being free of the stun, leaving you little time to react, especially with the combination of the other bullets previously mentioned.

BEMP will usually start to struggle a bit against heavy waves. You will need to find ways to graze off other bullets, such as darts or even pellets. Against higher rank daily missions, BEMP can be difficult to sustain due to how heavy and dense waves can get. As a pure defensive tool, you must quickly work to eliminate enough invaders to create enough breathing space for yourself before you get cornered with the tiniest BEMPs which can be difficult to save you, especially in Marshal missions when the bullets get really messy and come in fast.
