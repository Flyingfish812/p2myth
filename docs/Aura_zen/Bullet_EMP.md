## Comments

- Editor: Just stop wasting efforts, shurikens.
- ☀🐕: Default BEMP should be made to deal 10 damage since it’s not a powerful Aura anyway. A buff like this will make Aurora more playable. Destructive Wave Apex should be made to deal higher damage accordingly.

## APEX 1: Destructive Wave

- Game Description: An Enhanced Bullet EMP that also deals damage to Invaders.
- Numeric Interpretation: Bullet EMP deals at most 10 damage to invaders within range.
- Score: 4.64 / 5
- Ships with the APEX: Juggernaut (Lambda), Lyova (Tau), Phoenix (Delta), Shinova (Delta)

> Editor: A qualitative improvement, capable of both offense and defense. When facing shielded invaders, remember to break the shield first before using the aura.

- Numeric Interpretation: The max radius increases from 450 to 500.
- Score: 2.18 / 5
- Ships with the APEX: Mirage (Delta), Shinova (Alpha), Tempest (Beta)

> Editor: Stretching your hand a bit, but it seems like it hasn't actually stretched.

## APEX 3: Increased Stun

- Game Description: Expert tunning slightly increases the stun duration.
- Numeric Interpretation: The max stun time increases from 0.6s to 1.2s.
- Score: 1.70 / 5
- Ships with the APEX: Mirage (Omega)

> Editor: What can you do with the extra 0.6 seconds? Perhaps offer a *friendly* greeting while charging up.

Increasing the stun duration doesn't bring about many changes. 0.6 seconds means that the stun merely serves as a reset, allowing you to refocus and face the enemy's attack again. Doubling it might mislead you into thinking there's plenty of time left for stunning, causing you to pause and charge up Zen. Another issue is that this APEX is only equipped on the Mirage (Nightfury Laser), and the Nightfury Laser is notorious for its long charging time. Although the stun duration is increased, it may still not be enough time for you to charge up the laser again before it cools down. Lastly, the price of 50,000 is simply too expensive; you might not even consider purchasing it solely for this skill.

## APEX 4: Bullet Detonator

- Game Description: Enemy bullets are detonated dealing Blast damage.
- Numeric Interpretation: Each detonated bullet deals 2 AOE damage.
- Score: 4.27 / 5
- Ships with the APEX: Disaris (Omega)

> Editor: Playing games for so long just for this moment of excitement.

Transplanting the Bullet Detonators of Point Defense onto the Bullet EMP is truly a genius idea. This APEX greatly enhances the entertainment value of Disaris, giving it a chance to compete with veteran speedrun ships in MIRV Spam missions. Typically, in missions, you need to wait until the bullets cover the invaders before decisively using the Bullet EMP to cause widespread damage. In other words, as an offensive measure, the best use is to dive into the bullets, clearing all bullets when your ship is almost surrounded by bullets. One successful aspect of this APEX is that the main weapon used in conjunction is fully guided, meaning your attention doesn't need to be focused on aiming the main weapon, allowing you to allocate more attention to the timing of using the Bullet EMP. Finally, because the entertainment value of this APEX outweighs its practicality and it costs 50,000 credits, careful consideration is still needed before obtaining it.
