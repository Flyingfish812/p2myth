> Editor: It looks a bit bigger, but it's just that little bit bigger.

This APEX merely expands the stun range, but does not increase the damage of the ion cannon. In a sense, it's useless.

When the ion cannon can stun an entire invader, this skill has some room for maneuver. Even if the range is small, it stuns a large number of invaders. But now? It only stuns the turrets in this area. In the current version, this APEX is just a negligible bonus. If you can easily clear the mission using the original APEX, buying this APEX is simply a waste of money.
