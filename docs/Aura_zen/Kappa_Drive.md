<img src="/terms/KD.png" style={{zoom:1.25}}/>

More useful on radius based Auras than counter based Auras since any amount of using Kappa will almost always help. A very useful dodging tool, thus highly recommended for beginner players. Even helps pros in the toughest missions. Best abused on a bigger screen.

The details of this skill are listed as follows:

| Level                    | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | Ultimate |
| ------------------------ | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | -------- |
| Attraction Power (%)     | 100  | 129  | 157  | 186  | 214  | 214      |
| Generator Efficiency (%) | 100  | 114  | 129  | 143  | 157  | 157      |

- Ultimate: Slows down time by 50% (half the normal game speed, like playing a YouTube video at ×0.5 speed) when Kappa Drive is active.
- Score: 3.82 / 10
- Useful Levels: 1, Ult
- Priority Level: 1 / 8
- Illustration: The first one shows that you can attract energy particles quickly; The second one shows that you can generate energy particles of your own; The third one shows that you can slow down the game time.

## Comments

- Editor: You really need so much energy?
- ☀🐕: Kappa Drive is actually a supportive Aura with no defense capabilities because the time slow can be made up by quicker reaction time from the player, unless it’s bullet hell. Due to its supportive nature, KD will become much more powerful if it stops energy absorption while Aura is full to prevent overflow.

## APEX 1: Antigrav

- Game Description: Ignore energy particle weight and increase passive attraction power.
- Numeric Interpretation: All the particles will be attracted on the same speed and you can absorb energy more easily.
- Score: 0.55 / 5
- Ships with the APEX: Gladius (Gamma), Marauder (Alpha), Oran (Beta), Vuxine (Alpha), Zephyr (Beta)

> Editor: Imagine you sucking on the bubbles in your bubble milk tea.

This Apex pulls in all types of particles at the same speed while Kappa is active. In other words, gold, green and blue particles are all drawn in by Kappa at the same speed with this apex, while normally green and gold particles are drawn in much slower than blue particles as they are heavier. It also increases the speed at which particles are attracted to your ship even while Kappa is not active. Particle weight is also negated even when Kappa is not active.
