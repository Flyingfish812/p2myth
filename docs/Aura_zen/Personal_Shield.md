Probably the most difficult Zen to use. Generally underpowered but it has its niche uses where in such circumstances, shines above nearly all other Zens. The very long cooldown time means this Zen is really only for the pros.

The details of this skill are listed as follows:

| Level                    | 1               | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | Ultimate |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | -------- |
| Max Duration (s)         | 2.5             | 2.75 | 3.0  | 3.25 | 3.5  | 3.5      |
| Charging Duration (s)    | 0.6             | 0.55 | 0.5  | 0.45 | 0.4  | 0.4      |
| Charge Time Increase (s) | 3.0             | 2.75 | 2.5  | 2.25 | 2    | 2        |
| Charge Time Recovery (s) | Very Slow (8.5) | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~        |

- Ultimate: Adds Laser Reflection, which deals 10 damage / (laser*second) that hits the PS back to a random target (which may not be the source of the laser).
- Score: 5.91 / 10
- Useful Levels: 1, Ult
- Priority Level: 1 / 8

## Usage

The utility of PS is quite underrated. Many players think that PS is nothing more than simply being a laser reflector to deal damage back to invaders, or simply just a means of defence against lasers. Many players do not think of the utility of PS against bullets, which while isn't much, it is very useful in dire situations. 

The very less known fact about PS is that it has a very tiny Phase Out time, maybe approximately 0.25s. This does not seem like much, but think of it like a Chrono Phase Out time. The Phase Out time of PS is able to cut your way through walls of bullets, particularly shuriken clouds or pellets (whether lanes or simply just being annoying random pellets flooding the field). It is thus of extreme importance to practice the Phase Out of PS in order to maximize the bullet clear it is able to provide, in order to know how much it can clear. As a general guide, it can help you cut through about one-eighth of the screen width. Use this fact to help you cut through walls and position yourself in a better spot either on the offence, or simply to escape the looming death. PS Phase Out is also very useful in dealing against pellets released by MIRV Deathonators, as you can deploy PS for a split second and then push your way past the mess of pellets. Just be careful not to use it when the next wave has enough lasers you can reflect.

While PS is active, gameplay speed is reduced by 25%. This also means that while it is advertised that the Max duration of PS is 3.5s, the actual duration is 4.67s (3.5√∑0.75), as the 3.5s refer to in-game time. The rather long duration of PS allows you to have time to decide how long you want to continue staying to block off additional bullets, especially bullets coming from weird directions that are not consistent with the rest of the bullets around it. However, always plan your escape immediately as 4.67s will not feel like a long time and you must quickly Phase Out when the opportunity hits.

The thing about PS is, there is not much purpose for an increased duration. You would seldom use the full duration of PS since it is only used to either cut through bullets, or used to reflect lasers. Neither of which purpose is needed for the full duration since laser bursts only last 1s, while cutting through bullets don't usually require more than what is probably 0.25s. However, the longer duration helps nevertheless, particularly against MIRVs which feature a sudden speed-up in bullets that you want to block off, since MIRVs move slowly and you would sometimes want to get rid of that cluster of MIRVs before being safe to exit.

Another useful function is to block off more than one barrage of invader weaponry, particularly, against both lasers and boomerangs which usually come in separate bursts. As a completely invincible shield, PS is one of the best tools against boomerangs since it can last through the entire burst of boomerangs without running into extra risk. Just bear in mind don't attempt to hold out PS for 2 bursts of boomerangs, because it's not long enough to do that even at max level.

As a last minute defence it works very well since it's quick to charge, but once again, like TP, it is not instant, so be sure not to do it very last minute when a bullet is right up your core. The upgrades in level slightly decrease the level of pre-emption, but honestly, it's not anythign very significant.

PS works very well with burst mains as well as LS, as the both would continue to deal damage, making your exit slightly safer from the destruction of some invaders or turrets.

Because of the Very Slow Recovery of PS, it is usually not used in light waves. PS will usually see usage once per medium wave, as well as heavy or dense waves. In very heavy waves, or dense and heavy waves, PS can be used twice.

Upgraded to the ult level, it is pretty self explanatory how to use it. Simply use it to block off lasers when lasers are present. However, it is not always beneficial to block off lasers if the laser density is sparse. As a general guide, if there are still more than 6 lasers that are going to be fired in one burst, PS should benefit. If not, it is better to simply dodge them and use your main to deal more damage and kill the invaders off faster, unless you are really cornered with no other means of escape. As an extra note, this is not to say that a non-ult PS is useless against lasers. In fact, it is the contrary as it is pretty much the only reliable tool against lasers in desperate times where your Aura may not be big enough to cover all laser turrets. Of course though, the utility of PS against lasers is much more useful when ult-ed.

PS can also be used to effectively block off DDLs. Take note that normal lasers will fire first before DDLs do. However, the duration of an ult PS is just long enough to last through both the initial normal laser burst and the DDL. If the entire PS isn't within the DDL, it is even possible to Phase Out away from the DDL if you think it won't last.
