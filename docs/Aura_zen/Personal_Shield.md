Probably the most difficult Zen to use. Generally underpowered but it has its niche uses where in such circumstances, shines above nearly all other Zens. The very long cooldown time means this Zen is really only for the pros.

The details of this skill are listed as follows:

| Level                    | 1               | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | Ultimate |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | -------- |
| Max Duration (s)         | 2.5             | 2.75 | 3.0  | 3.25 | 3.5  | 3.5      |
| Charging Duration (s)    | 0.6             | 0.55 | 0.5  | 0.45 | 0.4  | 0.4      |
| Charge Time Increase (s) | 3.0             | 2.75 | 2.5  | 2.25 | 2    | 2        |
| Charge Time Recovery (s) | Very Slow (8.5) | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~        |

- Ultimate: Adds Laser Reflection, which deals 10 damage / (laser*second) that hits the PS back to a random target (which may not be the source of the laser).
- Score: 5.91 / 10
- Useful Levels: 1, Ult
- Priority Level: 1 / 8
- Illustration: The fiest one shows you how to defend yourself from assaults; The second one shows that you can reflect lasers to deal damage; The third one shows that you can use PS as an eraser to clear bullets nearby.

## Comments

- Editor: The rickety boat sailed in the sea of bullets.
- ☀🐕: The defensive aspect of PS is crap when not taking account of laser reflection. Let’s buff it so that the shield persists even after ship moving and firing.

## APEX 2: Super Reflect

- Game Description: Split-second shield activation just before laser firing will reflect back with extra force.
- Numeric Interpretation: The lasers hitting the shield at the first 0.5s will be reflected back with 5x damage.
- Score: 4.18 / 5
- Ships with the APEX: Essin (Gamma), NC-150 (Beta), Njorun (Gamma), Torrent (Beta), Widget (Delta)

> Editor: One for five at the limit.

This apex allows PS to deal 5 times the normal Laser Reflection damage, but only for a very short initial activation duration which only lasts for roughly 0.5s. An hexagon shaped PS indicates this duration, and lasers reflected during this duration will have an extra large width, although they suffer the same random targeting nature. As a reference, 8 laser super reflected (with a bit of prior damage to the Shield with a 34.375 DPS SB weapon) instantly destroys a Shield Roc.

> Editor: Finally, did you discover it? Personal shields are essentially erasers.

Simply put, when you press your finger back on the screen to control the ship, a regular shield will disappear in a short time, while this APEX allows the shield to last one more second. Perhaps you know that the Personal Shield itself has the function of an eraser; as long as you slide your finger forward while pressing back on the screen, the shield can break through more bullets. This use of the eraser is applicable in many missions.

However, it will have a certain impact on the main weapon because during the time when the shield has not disappeared, the main weapon seems not to attack, meaning the rhythm of the attack will be disrupted to some extent, which is not good news. Overall, the application range of this APEX is not particularly wide. For Centurion, you can completely choose another APEX to start with, or simply use the base form.
