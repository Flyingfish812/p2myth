<img src="/terms/mb.png" style={{zoom:1.25}}/>

High skill offensive Zen. Wipes out crowds with relative ease (or with absolute ease in the case of Hull invaders). The long charge time and no bullet clearing capabilities mean that MB can be hard to pull off quite often, thus it is not for the intermediate and below skill players.

The details of this skill are listed as follows:

| Level                    | 1             | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | Ultimate |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | -------- |
| Damage                   | 30            | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~        |
| Radius                   | 300           | 325  | 350  | 375  | 400  | 400      |
| Charging Duration (s)    | 2             | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~        |
| Charge Time Increase (s) | 0.4           | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~        |
| Charge Time Recovery (s) | Average (4.5) | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~        |

- Ultimate: Adds a Fusion Core damage of 40. This means that any invaders are underneath the blue glowing orb when MB goes off receive 70 damage compared to other invaders that are not underneath the glowing blue orb which will receive the normal 30 damage.
- Score: 9.18 / 10
- Useful Levels: 1, Ult
- Priority Level: 1 / 8

## Comments

- Editor: Gorgeous explosion, ultimate damage.
- ‚òÄüêï: A very potent offensive Zen. Damaging wise it‚Äôs significantly more efficient than ML. Downside would be that Darts (T2 Darts excluded) limits MB positioning and spamming greatly. Though wave compositions are rather simple in the current version of the game so it‚Äôs not that hard to maximize its damaging potential.

## Usage

The only change in MB as you upgrade it is the increase in radius. Thus, there is actually not much change in gameplay from a level 1 MB to a level 5 MB. Due to its long charge time at all levels and also having no bullet clearing capabilities (Discounting the MBc BEMP apex), MB is a very hard Zen to use that heavily emphasizes risk taking. You must also be able to quickly decide when firing your main weapon / Aura might be more beneficial instead. Generally, if there are only Eagles or larger on field, it might be a better idea to cancel if your MB still has more than 1s left to charge finish. Due to its inability to clear bullets, it is extremely risky to charge MB without being at the bottom of the screen. There are many exceptions however, such as your ship having a defensive Aura to aid your exit from MB, or invaders having no dart tracking turrets to shoot you at point blank. MB is almost always charged between wave or Act transitions.

When ult, the risk vs reward factor becomes even more apparent, and there is even more reward to charge MB upfield. Not all MB ships are able to utilize this ult properly however. MB requires prior knowledge of every wave so as to land the MBc on the most appropriate invader(s). This comes with grinding and experience. The general rule of thumb is to land MBc on larger invaders, such as 2 Herons / Eagles, or the Vulture. It is usually extremely dangerous and thus not recommended to land MBc on a group of Shield / Armor Ravens due to the point blank range of their turrets to you. Hull Ravens die instantly from the MB explosion itself so there is no need to land MBc on Ravens.

It is important to note that the epicenter of MB is based on the center of the Fusion Core, and not where your core is. The AoE is thus dependent on the position of the Fusion Core, and not your core.

MB is always pulled off once per wave, since there is simply no point to pull it off a second time due to the charge time increase, as well as almost all of the smaller invaders being dead, leaving the larger ones remaining which can never be so many to justify the use of a 2nd MB. The MB is better left to cool down since using 2 MBs in a row mean the current wave will get wiped out too fast, and the next wave which is almost always more beneficial to charge MB will no longer have the chance to pull of MB due to the massive charge time increase. The only exception to this rule is if you have the SB MB apex, since consecutive MB blasts have even higher DPS than your main weapon itself, even with subsequent long charge times.

Obviously, due to the huge AoE MB has, it is extremely effective against dense waves. However, the inability to kill off most types and affinities of invaders limit it's usefulness to simply being nothing more than a tool to deal damage, instead of being able to directly deal with the threats from bullets. Particularly, Shield / Armor Ravens hiding behind a Vulture will prove a problem as they cannot be destroyed instantly and will pump in lots of bullets. In such cases, it may sometimes be more advantageous to charge MB all the way upfield and land MBc on these pesky Ravens or Herons, and proceed to use your main weapon to eliminate the rest of them hiding behind the Vulture before heading back down to deal with the Vulture and other invaders in front. Shield Ravens are particularly problematic since they will regenerate their shield after the MB if you leave them alone to deal with the Vulture, decreasing the usefulness of MB. (However, the SB MB apex completely eliminates this problem, which is a massive boost.) With Armor Ravens, the problem is not as severe, but nevertheless, an issue with these Ravens continuing to pump in bullets and lasers into the field.

MB is probably the most versatile offensive tool against daily missions. It can be used in all types of waves, from light, to dense, to heavy waves. It can be abused at any opportunity possible. Particularly, in dense or heavy waves, many of the tracking turrets only fire a single bullet per burst, which are likely misaimed since most fire quickly once the invaders land on field. This means it is quite safe to charge MB so long you pick a spot where you aren't directly under a turret. However, it is most useful in dense or heavy waves since light waves are better reserved for MB cooldown.
