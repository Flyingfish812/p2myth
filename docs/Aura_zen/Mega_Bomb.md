# Mega Bomb

> Deals considerable AOE damage to all the invaders within range.

<img src="/terms/mb.png" style={{zoom:1.25}}/>

High skill offensive Zen. Wipes out crowds with relative ease (or with absolute ease in the case of Hull invaders). The long charge time and no bullet clearing capabilities mean that MB can be hard to pull off quite often, thus it is not for the intermediate and below skill players.

The details of this skill are listed as follows:

| Level                    | 1             | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | Ultimate |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | -------- |
| Damage                   | 30            | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~        |
| Radius                   | 300           | 325  | 350  | 375  | 400  | 400      |
| Charging Duration (s)    | 2             | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~        |
| Charge Time Increase (s) | 0.4           | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~        |
| Charge Time Recovery (s) | Average (4.5) | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~        |

- Ultimate: Adds a Fusion Core damage of 40. This means that any invaders are underneath the blue glowing orb when MB goes off receive 70 damage compared to other invaders that are not underneath the glowing blue orb which will receive the normal 30 damage.

## Comments

- Editor: Gorgeous explosion, ultimate damage.
- ☀🐕: A very potent offensive Zen. Damaging wise it’s significantly more efficient than ML. Downside would be that Darts (T2 Darts excluded) limits MB positioning and spamming greatly. Though wave compositions are rather simple in the current version of the game so it’s not that hard to maximize its damaging potential.
