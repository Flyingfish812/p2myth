## Comments

- Editor: You cannot count on it to clear all the bullets.
- ☀🐕: As a defensive only Aura PD sucks. A nice change would be to implement Bullet Detonator into the ult-upgrade. Bullet Detonator Apexes should therefore be made to deal higher damage. And the efficient MIRV clearing capability from the original ult-upgrade should be granted at level 1.
