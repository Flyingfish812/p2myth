> Releasing several laser beams to clear the bullets

<img src="/terms/pd.png" style={{zoom:1.25}}/>

A scalpel/precision strike BEMP. Recommended for intermediate level players who can dodge reasonably well.

The details of this skill are listed as follows:

| Level           | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | Ultimate |
| --------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | -------- |
| Number of Beams | 2    | 4    | 6    | 8    | 10   | 10       |
| Efficiency (%)  | 100  | 120  | 150  | 200  | 300  | 300      |
| Max Radius      | 250  | 290  | 330  | 370  | 410  | 410      |

- Ultimate: Allows you to eliminate MIRVs with only one laser beam instead of 5.
- Score: 4.91 / 10
- Useful Levels: Approximately 4-Ult
- Priority Level: 4 / 8

## Comments

- Editor: You cannot count on it to clear all the bullets.
- ‚òÄüêï: As a defensive only Aura PD sucks. A nice change would be to implement Bullet Detonator into the ult-upgrade. Bullet Detonator Apexes should therefore be made to deal higher damage. And the efficient MIRV clearing capability from the original ult-upgrade should be granted at level 1. 

## Usage

Level 1 PD is one of the worst defensive Auras in the game as it does nearly nothing. It is, however, useful in breaking holes in pellet walls in order to escape the pellet lanes to make last minute defensive measures to possibly avoid being trapped. However, this has to be done pre-emptively before other faster bullets such as darts and boomerangs come for you It is however, completely useless against darts and boomerangs, and the extreme inefficiency of PD with only 2 laser beams mean that it is ineffective against shurikens which come in messes. To deal with shurikens, you have to spread them out by making rapid strafes to thin out the shuriken walls so that you can break through them. Your hope in using a low level PD is to spam tap.

As you upgrade PD, it becomes a lot more responsive and a lot more effective, being better able to deal with more and more types of bullets. Eventually, it becomes a semi effective tool against MIRVs when it reaches the ult level. However, it is no means that most effective against MIRVs due to them being the slowest bullets in the game, which means that it is very difficult to get PD to actually target them. In fact, it is more often than not, more efficient to simply explode them and eliminate some of their released pellets rather than using PD to plow through the other bullets around it. This should be done when you are faced with a wall of shurikens around it, or when there are too many pellet lanes around it. If there are only around less than 4 dart lanes around it, you may actually consider draining PD a bit to eliminate a cluster of perhaps at least 3 MIRVs around it. This is particularly useful against laser MIRVs, since bullets around it travel very fast and you may opt to simply eliminate all the darts and boomerangs around it to eliminate the laser MIRVs which can prove to be deadly in large numbers (when released by MIRV Spreads or Bloomers).

Think of PD more like a last minute BEMP at times. It is able to save you from certain death, but it is only useful when used in small amounts. Holding on to PD and therefore using it in large amounts, PD drains extremely fast which is no longer effective. PD should only be used in the most dire situations, or when you wish to reposition yourself to jump across lanes of pellets or darts. Never hold on to PD when faced with a crowd of bullets as that will backfire later. You should only do very brief taps in very desperate situations, or if you need to reposition yourself at the other side of the field, used in very short holds. This is because PD should be only used to eliminate the most dangerous bullets which are in closest proximity to you. When making the jump to reposition, holding it down means eliminating you unnecessary bullets that are further away from you as well, which serves no purpose. Instead, using it in bursts allows PD to constantly re-evaluate the most dangerous bullets nearest to you more effectively, thus reducing wastage. When faced with boomerangs however, unfortunately, you will need to do start using PD a little earlier (approximately 0.5s earlier or something) to clear off a bit of bullets around you as even though a max level PD is quite efficient, it may be difficult to target the boomerangs at the very brief moment it enters critical range, leaving insufficient time for PD to target the boomerangs.

PD should be used to move in the appropriate direction according to the wave formation. For dense waves with small invaders in front, you should push yourself forward slowly while moving sideways very slightly to avoid head-on bullets. This allows you to collect the particles from these invaders to sustain PD. For heavy waves, PD should generally be used to move sideways, not against the direction bullets are coming from. This is because going head-on, and directly against the flow will face more resistance, draining PD faster. (The same anology is that going against the flow of the river is harder than attempting to cross one.)

For some ships, PD is used as an aggressive positioning tool to get up close to invaders. In such cases, PD should be spam tapped, and still not held on to. However, bear in mind that when the field becomes slightly more dense in bullets, it is no longer possible to use PD for such aggressive close encounters with invaders and PD reverts back to normal usage. This is especially so for speedrunning with such ships, where you must be very careful of your PD usage and always leave at least a small usable radius to defend yourself.

The good thing about PD is it refills quite fast and the smallest PD from natural Aura regeneration can still fire off one burst of PD, which can eliminate as many bullets as it can lock onto (usually it's up to about a maximum of 6 bullets when you desparately tapping it). This means that with a bit of grazing, you can gain enough Aura to eliminate the most immediate threatening bullets around you and continue staying alive. This however, still require you to dodge anything faster than a pellet as the grazing and regeneration are not fast enough to deal against darts. Such a last minute desperate PD works like level 1 PD or a very tiny BEMP. This actually allows you to survive infinitely so long you are careful to keep as still as possible, only moving just enough to avoid any darts. This won't usually work against boomerangs since boomerangs have a larger hit circle which requires more movement.
