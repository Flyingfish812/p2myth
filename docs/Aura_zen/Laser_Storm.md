# Laser Storm

> A group of laser moons continue to attack invaders ahead.

<img src="/terms/ls.png" style={{zoom:1.25}}/>

Very underpowered Aura. Main purpose is to pop turrets off. Not really recommended for anyone, even pros or beginners alike.

The details of this skill are listed as follows:

| Level             | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | Ultimate |
| ----------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | -------- |
| Laser Moon Number | 3    | 3    | 4    | 4    | 5    | 5        |
| Max Damage        | 89   | 94   | 98   | 103  | 107  | 112      |
| Max Radius        | 350  | 375  | 400  | 425  | 450  | 450      |

- Ultimate: Laser Moons prioritize active turrets, which means that they will target turrets that are not dead, and after they are dead, they will no longer target it. The Laser Moons will also ignore cockpits where possible (unless there are no active turrets in range).
- Score: 5.45 / 10
- Useful Levels: Ult
- Priority Level: 6 / 8

## Comments

- Editor: They look like light balls in a ballroom.
- ☀🐕: Proposal (1) Unlimited range; (2) Laser Moons are always deployed even while not activated, therefore eliminates the deployment and withdrawal time; (3) Add two counters to prevent energy overflow. Upon activation, counters are always used first if both the Aura and counters are full. With the changes mentioned above, LS gets to keep its relatively low DPS while its versatility and energy efficiency is improved. (Flyingfish: I mean, it all sounds perfect. But like LS is meant to be a more relaxing Aura from the get-go. Plus, it seems a little bit complicated program wise.)
- 大白白龙: The Tac Moon is actually an exclusively enhance for Ogon so that it can clear many difficult missions.
- 圆锥曲线: Laser Storm's High Power is also useful if you know how to use it.

## APEX 1: High Power

- Game Description: A constellation of Laser Moons outputs all damage in less time.
- Numeric Interpretation: The laser moons increases from 5 to 8, the max duration decreases from 4.5s to 2.25s.
- Score: 3.36 / 5
- Ships with the APEX: Buhloo (Epsilon), Elyon (Beta), Fujin (Sigma), Lokie (Delta)

> Editor: In high-difficulty missions, a half-hearted attack is not suitable.

## APEX 2: Tac Moons

- Game Description: Two Tactical Super Moons concentrate their firepower to dispose individual targets more quickly.
- Numeric Interpretation: 2 Laser Moons with stronger power will focus on invaders concentrately.
- Score: 1.91 / 5
- Ships with the APEX: Havoc (Gamma), Ogon (Beta)

> Editor: Tactical big guy, must be brought out in critical moments.

This apex modifies LS such that now there are only 2 laser moons shooting 2 highly concentrated lasers on turrets, popping turrets significantly faster. As per usual LS ult, it will switch targets once the turret is dead. The total damage remains unchanged.

There are certain patterns regarding target prioritization: Similar to a regular Laser Storm, controlling the distance between the ship and the invader such that only one or two attack targets are within the aura, indicated by the golden small circles inside the aura, can form a focus fire. This is because the essence of Laser Storm is a subset of aggregation. However, this APEX adds several conditions on top of this:

1. The horizontal distance between the target and the ship's core is inversely proportional to the priority of being attacked.
2. The health of the invader's main body is directly proportional to the priority of its turret being attacked.

Combining these two points may explain why sometimes it doesn't attack targets that are closer. Large turrets require four hits to be destroyed, and during turret popping, each shot from Laser Storm takes 0.5 seconds. This means that Laser Storm can transition after the 4th attack begins, allowing Laser Storm to continue attacking, and then immediately switch to the next target.

## APEX 3: Shield Breaker

- Game Description: Laser Moon type S deals extra damage to shields.
- Numeric Interpretation: Lasers deal 2.5x damage to shields.
- Score: 3.09 / 5
- Ships with the APEX: Elyon (Lambda), Reaper (Tau), Xaniea (Tau)

> Editor: Quickly breaking shields is an urgent need for slow-paced weapons.
> Appearance enthusiasts rejoice, as the so-called cost-effectiveness is linked to demand. If the pursuit is aesthetics, then this APEX is worth it.

This is a very effective enhancement in shield missions because breaking shields quickly means that the High Impact main weapons can perform more efficiently. Besides, it has no difference from regular Laser Storm, so you'll only use them in shield missions. But before purchasing these APEXs, carefully consider whether the other APEX for those ships offer better value.
