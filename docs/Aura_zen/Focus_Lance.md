Basically it's a free VL at the start and midpoint of every wave. However, it is actually quick to recharge unlike many Zens and can be abused to some extent.

The details of this skill are listed as follows:

| Level                    | 1             | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | Ultimate |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | -------- |
| Damage                   | 39.6          | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~        |
| Charging Duration (s)    | 0.75          | 0.65 | 0.55 | 0.45 | 0.35 | 0.35     |
| Charge Time Increase (s) | 1.8           | 1.6  | 1.4  | 1.2  | 1.0  | 1.0      |
| Charge Time Recovery (s) | Average (4.5) | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~        |

- Ultimate: Gives it Armor Piercing properties, which makes it deal normal damage to Armored invaders. The important implications are being able to one shot Armored Ravens, as well as instantly being able to pop off a turret on an Armored invader.
- Score: 6.09 / 10
- Useful Levels: 4 and above
- Priority Level: 1 / 8

## Comments

- Editor: The worst imitation of aura until the appear of Clover ATS.
- ‚òÄüêï: The weirdest part of FL is its ult-upgrade. Why AP only when I don‚Äôt get any benefits from playing missions other than Armored? Hence, SB and HI damage type should also be added. In addition, I‚Äôve always thought that FL is a bit generic since it‚Äôs just a single charge of VL. Unlike FL though, a 4 VL dump instantly vaporizes a screen full of enemies. It‚Äôd be cool to see a 65 damage FL for one-shotting herons.

## Usage

A level 1 FL is pretty much useless due to how sluggish it is, requiring you to pre-charge so early it is simply ridiculous to estimate, especially when you are still dealing with some of the bullets left over from the last wave. As you upgrade FL, it becomes more responsive, and also more abusable.

Unfortunately, even at max or ult level, FL is still very underwhelming as a Zen. Given the speed of FL and taking into account the time you need to stay still to charge it, you can only hope and pray that the FL will hit as many Ravens and Sparrows as possible. Given their rapid movement, it is extremely unpredictable, in that they can quickly move away just as FL is being emitted from your ship.

The fact that FL needs to cool down is another factor that makes FL very difficult to wield properly. By the time FL has cooled down, while it may not be that long (it's about 5 seconds i would say), it is enough time for the field to be flooded with fast moving bullets such as boomerangs and darts. This means that it is very difficult to reposition yourself in a new spot where using FL might be viable. It's Aura counterpart, VL, allows multiple piercing lances to be fired at once, riding the field of invaders quickly enough so that less bullets would be stacked upon you, as well as not running into positioning problems later on to fire more lances.

Thus, FL may be simply seen as a one-time lance at the start of a wave. After that, FL is usually only used to pop turrets off invaders, and it is simply a bonus if it can hit Ravens and Sparrows. FL can generally be used about twice a wave from Act 4 onwards, discounting light waves where it is only once. For dense and/or heavy waves, it can even be used 3 times.
