## Comments

- Editor: A good choice to break through the barrier.
- ‚òÄüêï: There are 3 major problems with ML. (1) Excessive damage is wasted on early acts, resulting in inefficiency in damage outputting. So buffing ML damage is actually pointless. (2) ML has poor synergy with SB ships. For instance, sometimes ML strips away all shield on a larger invader, leaving no shield for an SB weapon to break. Exceptions are Exarch and Razor VI. Exarch has a cone triggered main meaning it can fire a round of its SB beams while charging ML. While Razor VI is able to charge ML right at the start of its main firing, stripping shield first, and then hitting hull with ML. (3) Enemies‚Äô fast lasers limit ML usage to a great extent on some ships, so it‚Äôs better to reduce ML charge time to 1 second. Additionally, ML should be able to clear bullets from the core of the ship to prevent death after it firing.

## Usage

Level 1 Mega Laser is the most sluggish thing in this game, and is only really usable either between Act transitions, or during wave transitions where the next wave has a frontline Vulture. Otherwise, it has no defensive aspect at all and only serves as an offensive tool that can make certain waves easier. However, as you upgrade ML, it becomes more and more responsive and it becomes possible to charge it between wave transitions with Level 3 or 4 and above.

ML is a great step to learning speedrunning and the basics of important positioning. The time taken to charge ML forces you to be careful where you station yourself at, as wrong positioning can lead to your death. However, there is some leniency in ML in the fact that it clears bullets ahead of you once fired. With the ult, it has a little bit more leniency. Also, it does not matter, vertically, where you start charging ML. Only your horizontal position matters. This means ML is almost always charged at the bottom of the screen. The rule of thumb with ML is, just charge it whenever you can between wave or Act transitions. There are rare cases where ML can also be charged mid-wave. It is likely because there are no dart tracking turrets or boomerangs around. Thus, it is usually possible to abuse ML in MIRV/Shuriken missions, more than once per wave. Some waves in MIRV/Shuriken missions may even see a usage of up to 3 or 4 MLs depending on the overall health of the wave. Charging ML between pellet lanes is a very useful skill, but when dealing with pellet lanes of a T4 pellet spinner, it may be dangerous, but highly rewarding if estimated correctly.

Many ships rely on ML's bullet clearing capabilities a fair bit. Particularly, it is helpful since you can ride up the ML, meaning you move forward and upfield together with the ML. This move allows you to quickly collect particles from the invaders that were killed, as well as particles that may be left behind in the previous wave (since you didn't collect them when charging at the bottom). It benefits both offensive and defensive Auras equally. It may also be a useful move when bullets are approaching from the sides where you charged ML since you can quickly escape them. Take note that there is usually a tiny gap between the start of the ML itself and your core. This means that there is a small chance that a bullet in front of you will not be eliminated even after you fire off ML. If you see a bullet too close for comfort after firing ML, you should instead pull yourself back to the bottom of the screen quickly to avoid a high chance of death.

The problem with ML is the very fact that the horizontal position matters, and with such a long charge time, many small invaders may potentially escape the ML when it finally fires. It is thus important to understand the layout of the wave where you charge ML, and charge based on the initial formation. For example, if the right column is long, you should align yourself with the right column. However, it is usually better to offset closer to center. Conversely, if you are aiming at the middle column of invaders, it is better to slightly offset to the left or right, usually somewhere close to the 1/4 or 3/4 margin. This allows you to have a higher chance to catch invaders from 2 columns instead of one. This offset is unnecessary if you have a Vulture behind everything since it will definitely soak up the spilled damage. With 2 Eagles at the back, the offset is still helpful, especially if they choose to split apart. With large invaders on field, ML is bound to deal devastating damage since they soak up everything and there is no damage spill.

When speedrunning, in Acts 1-3 (Acts 1-2 if daily missions), it is almost always beneficial to release ML a bit earlier than the moment the invaders fully arrive on field, so that you can quickly position yourself the opposite side where you charged ML to take out the remaining invaders. Even for an Eagle, you can slightly pre-fire ML to completely obliterate it, unless there are Ravens behind it. The less health the invaders of the first wave of the next Act have, the earlier you can simply Fire and Forget.

However, there are times where it is absolutely necessary to charge as corner as possible, in order to quickly reach the larger invaders behind so as to stop them from wrecking havoc. ML can thus be a tool to punch a hole in invader fronts such that you can directly deal with threats behind. With a Vulture or 4 Eagles in front blocking the way however, ML is not enough to plow your way through to reach the potentially troublesome invaders at the back. In such cases, it may sometimes be beneficial to charge above the rest of the invaders to reach the Vulture behind to kill it quickly, especially if it has very dangerous turrets.

In very dense or heavy waves, it generally no longer matters where you charge ML. If it's an armor mission however, it will serve you better to try your best to aim straight on to one column of invaders so that there is a better chance to hit the cockpit of invaders. In light waves, there is no point to charge an ML unless it's the start of a new Act. Be careful not to launch an ML if you expect a very heavy wave after the starting wave of the incoming Act. If you possess an Aura that does not deal AoE damage, it is better to use the offensive Aura to clear out the light waves.

Because ML takes so long to charge, it is a very useful burst reset tool, for ships with main weapons of the Burst class. You can fake charge an ML between waves, and if you know that your ML is unable to finish completion, cancel the ML and the main weapon straight away fires. It may also be useful for ships with main weapons of the Hybrid class. In Hybrid class weapons, it is usually more beneficial to allow the weapon cycle to complete (the weapon enters the cooldown state) before doing a fake charge.

(Description)

# Nightfury

The bigger brother of ML. Packs a serious punch, decimating frontline Vultures or 2 Eagles of pretty much any affinity. Unfortunately, it is difficult to abuse due to its Super Slow recovery rate.

| Level                    | 1                 | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | Ultimate |

- Priority Level: 3 / 8

## Comments

- Editor: If you get it, spend 100 credits to watch a firework show.
- ‚òÄüêï: The most unreasonable thing about Mirage is the 50k Apex Form. Couldn‚Äôt we just remake it so that it improves NF‚Äôs charge and recovery time?

## Usage

The Recovery Rate is roughly a reduction of 0.74s for every 10s not used. Please note that it is unlikely to be accurate since recovery rates are generally not linear. This means it takes around 10.78s for Nightfury to fully cooldown. Since each cycle of the Plasma Rays takes 3s, the general rule of thumb is to wait for 3-4 cycles before using Nightfury if you need it to go off quickly (which doesn't apply to MIRV/Shuriken missions).
