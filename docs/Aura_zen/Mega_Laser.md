> Deals huge damage to invaders in a straight line as well as the bullets.

<img src="/terms/ML.png" style={{zoom:1.25}}/>

Quite a straightforward offensive Zen. Positioning is key. Recommended for intermediate players and upwards. Most effective against thick columns of small invaders or big invaders.

The details of this skill are listed as follows:

| ------------------------ | ------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | -------- |
| Damage                   | 150           | 155  | 160  | 165  | 170  | 170      |
| Charging Duration (s)    | 2.3           | 2.2  | 2.1  | 2.0  | 1.9  | 1.9      |
| Charge Time Increase (s) | 0.5           | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~        |
| Charge Time Recovery (s) | Average (4.5) | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~        |

- Ultimate: Increases the width of ML to 150% of its original width.

## Comments

- Editor: A good choice to break through the barrier.
- ‚òÄüêï: There are 3 major problems with ML. (1) Excessive damage is wasted on early acts, resulting in inefficiency in damage outputting. So buffing ML damage is actually pointless. (2) ML has poor synergy with SB ships. For instance, sometimes ML strips away all shield on a larger invader, leaving no shield for an SB weapon to break. Exceptions are Exarch and Razor VI. Exarch has a cone triggered main meaning it can fire a round of its SB beams while charging ML. While Razor VI is able to charge ML right at the start of its main firing, stripping shield first, and then hitting hull with ML. (3) Enemies‚Äô fast lasers limit ML usage to a great extent on some ships, so it‚Äôs better to reduce ML charge time to 1 second. Additionally, ML should be able to clear bullets from the core of the ship to prevent death after it firing.

## APEX 1: Twin Laser

- Game Description: Heavily modified Meson Projectors can shoot two Mega Laser beams side by side.
- Numeric Interpretation: Two 100-damage lasers will be fired at the same time with a gap in between.
- Score: 3.55 / 5
- Ships with the APEX: EX04239 (Phi)

> Editor: Imagine stubbing your toe against a wall or experiencing a leg cramp while stretching.

Unlike the Double Shot, it can simultaneously fire two laser beams, covering a wider area and dealing higher damage. At first glance, this skill seems perfect, as it retains all the characteristics of the original laser and even enhances them. However, it encounters a problem in one aspect. There is a small gap between the two laser beams, and the bullets in this gap are not eliminated by the lasers. In other words, you cannot directly rush upwards following the lasers, or else you will collide with the bullets that slipped through. Of course, the solution is relatively simple; when you need to break through the bullets and move forward, slightly offset to the left or right, then follow the path cleared by the lasers and charge forward.

## APEX 2: Double Shot

- Game Description: Two separate energy releases create two beams in quick succession.
- Numeric Interpretation: Two 100-damage lasers will be fired one by one, with a one-second interval.
- Score: 3.00 / 5
- Ships with the APEX: Fujin (Epsilon), Hime (Epsilon), Monsoon (Epsilon), Photurius (Lambda)

> Editor: Not all weapons can come abundantly twice.

- Numeric Interpretation: The laser ignore 30% damage reduction of armors.
- Score: 3.18 / 5
- Ships with the APEX: Cinnri (Lambda), Hime (Lambda), Neni (Delta)

> Editor: No matter how hard the armor is, there are gaps.

## APEX 4: Focused Beam

- Game Description: Mega Laser power is concentrated in a smaller beam and deals more damage.

# Nightfury

<img src="/terms/NF.png" style={{zoom:1.25}}/>

The bigger brother of ML. Packs a serious punch, decimating frontline Vultures or 2 Eagles of pretty much any affinity. Unfortunately, it is difficult to abuse due to its Super Slow recovery rate.

| Level                    | 1                 | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | Ultimate |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | -------- |
| Damage                   | 200               | 225  | 250  | 275  | 300  | 300      |
| Charging Duration (s)    | 2.3               | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~        |
| Charge Time Increase (s) | 0.8               | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~        |
| Charge Time Recovery (s) | Super Slow (11.5) | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~    | ~        |

- Ultimate: Enables Bullet Destruction, which finally allows Nightfury to clear bullets in the 3 beams fired. A non-ult Nightfury does not clear any bullets
- Score: 6.45 / 10
- Useful Levels: 1, Ult
- Priority Level: 3 / 8

## Comments

- Editor: If you get it, spend 100 credits to watch a firework show.
- ‚òÄüêï: The most unreasonable thing about Mirage is the 50k Apex Form. Couldn‚Äôt we just remake it so that it improves NF‚Äôs charge and recovery time?

## Usage

The Recovery Rate is roughly a reduction of 0.74s for every 10s not used. Please note that it is unlikely to be accurate since recovery rates are generally not linear. This means it takes around 10.78s for Nightfury to fully cooldown. Since each cycle of the Plasma Rays takes 3s, the general rule of thumb is to wait for 3-4 cycles before using Nightfury if you need it to go off quickly (which doesn't apply to MIRV/Shuriken missions).
