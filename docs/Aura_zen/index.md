# Auras and Zens

## Introduction

In this section, we will discusses how each Aura and Zen evolves as their upgrades go, how upgrading them would help you, and detailed strategies to use them to maximum effect. 

It also attempts to give a priority system as to what Aura or Zen you should upgrade first when you first get a ship with a certain Aura Zen combination. The higher the priority number, the higher the priority. Thus if the Aura has a higher priority number than the Zen, then upgrade the Aura first, and vice versa.

Since you can only have one Aura and one Zen on a ship, several Auras are grouped together as one priority level, and several Zens are also grouped together.

The priority number goes up to 8. The most significant levels of each Aura and Zen are also indicated so you know where you might want to hold off the upgrade for a while.

## Aura

Aura is the skill that can be used as long as you have enough energy. There are 2 types of Aura skills: radius-based Aura and counter-based Aura. For a radius-based Aura like Bullet EMP, you can use it once your energy are stored for a minimum radius to activate the skill. For a counter-based Aura like Vorpal Lance, you can use it once your energy are stored for a counter to activate the skill.

## Zen

Zen is a skill that doesn't need energy to activate. When you move your finger off the screen, the Zen skill will be charged. After the use of a Zen skill, it may need time to recover its charging time. So it's important to decide where to use and how to use them effectively.
