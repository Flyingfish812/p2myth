Welcome to Phoenix 2 Update 6.2


This update has been long in the making, so here we go. The entire Phoenix 2 interface has been rebuilt from the ground up in our own game engine! All functions and features are generally the same and should be very familiar. One significant change is the removal of the navigation buttons at the bottom. You will now find these buttons on the main menu screen in their appropriate sections.


Using our own game engine allows us to use cool effects in the interface. More importantly, it will allow Phoenix 2 to be updated more easily with new features. Look for those in the near future. For this update, we have focused on the interface only.


With any large-scale change like this, there might be some new bugs! Please contact us if you encounter any issue or have feedback. You can email us via phoenix2@firigames.com, or find us on Discord or other social media. For links to these, see the credits section accessible through the Firi Games button on the main menu.


Thanks for playing Phoenix 2 and look out for more updates in the future!
