# 幻影

好玩的主炮、好玩的光环、好玩的禅宗，你还能奢求点啥呢？

## 基础篇

虽然会有些啰嗦，但对于后续展开来说，你最好能记一下：

- 省下一轮主炮大约等于省了1秒钟
- 几乎总是对每一幕的第1波使用巨型炸弹（例如，1-1、2-1等）
- 除非有必要，否则不要揣着满长矛
- 记住这些数值伤害很重要：
  - 1次主炮暴击可以消灭2个小型，或2个麻雀+1个小型
  - 2次主炮暴击可以消灭中型
  - 1次主炮暴击+穿刺长矛也可以消灭中型
- 小型+麻雀（2、4或更多的）应该总是在2轮主炮内解决
- 中小型总是需要2轮主炮，或穿刺长矛+1轮主炮
- 如果这一波有很多麻雀，你应该需要使用巨型炸弹，除非你非常自信（能只用主炮和长矛很快解决）
  - 见穿刺长矛的第2部分，有关微型群的穿刺长矛扫图示例
- 总是尽量立即使用穿刺长矛，这样就不用担心敌机乱飞（散开）

## 玩法

这架战机从根本上来说非常机械化；早期浪费一发长矛（例如在第1-2幕）会导致你后面的穿刺长矛不够用。不像其他竞速战机（幕府、鲍克斯迈尔、螃蟹等），有时一个小错误通常是无法挽回的，因此如果哪怕一次主炮扫射失败，建议立即重开一把。

此外，这架战机的变数很少，因此你通常能很稳定地出分。这可能取决于游戏风格，但我更喜欢低风险、一致的玩法（比如在每一波开始时使用穿刺长矛避免敌机乱跑），然后通过赌主炮的暴击来打出潜在的提速。这样做不那么令人沮丧，也更容易持续执行，但你也可以选择其它的玩法。

在每日任务中，可能需要两种策略的混合。如果一波敌机前排主要是很脆的那些（小型和麻雀），最好的办法总是一进场就射矛。如果前排敌机很硬（中型或中小型），根据配置的不同，两种办法都有可能用上。例如，如果后排是两个中型，最好是立即发射穿刺长矛，以避免中型可能分开的情况。然而，如果后排是小型，等它们排成一串可能是最佳选择。

不赌敌机聚拢的示例：

如果不指望敌机能好好地排成一串（比如前排有一排的小型和中小型），就在敌机停下的时候立即长矛扫图吧。等待敌机排好阵形会导致第一发主炮被浪费，所以我选择立即射矛避免浪费主炮。

不赌主炮暴击的玩法：

这种情况下，立即射出长矛没什么优势，因为前排的中型还会需要一次主炮。更好的选择是等待后排的小型排好队，然后再发射长矛。

## 主炮

和别的暴击主炮（例如螃蟹的）不同，幻影的主炮可以说成也暴击败也暴击。它的结果（如基础篇里提到的）就是根据有没有暴击，你可以省下一整秒。

### 主炮重置

通常，在先前的一波先把主炮打空是有好处的，它能让你的主炮在下一波更好地控制，从而更好地利用主炮横扫（如下图所示）：

这经常在2-2发生。你可以在2-1巨型炸弹炸完后先把主炮打空然后更好地瞄准，而不是省下这一发主炮并在2-2开始时立即开炮。这样你就不用赌敌机队形了。

注意，有时在某一幕第一波不打主炮是可行的（即，在第一波巨炸炸完后立即开始给下一个巨炸蓄力，以节省主炮），然后在使用穿刺长矛之前使用主炮。这个打法经常依赖于敌机的移动，只有在没有麻雀的情况下才推荐（例如1中小型2小型）。如果你不打算在第二波使用穿刺长矛，那我推荐你这么干。

### 主炮横扫

When there are 3 sparrows, it's always easy to main sweep. When there's 4, it can become rather difficult depending on the configuration. If all 4 fall in a row, it can be inconsistent and depends on whether the outer sparrows move outwards. If it's 4 in a box configuration, then you should wait for the 2 sparrows in a row to split, start from the one that's further out, and then swipe over and stop at the furthest out raven on the other side. 

4 sparrows in a row:

### Main Precharging 

I'm not sure if this is the correct term, but the basic idea is to finish off one wave with the main, and utilize the downtime it takes for the main to kill to start charging the MB on the next wave. Depending on the health of what you're trying to kill, you can save up to 400 additional milliseconds (under the assumption it takes a full burst to kill the target invader) of preloading your MB, which can make or break the next wave. 

![alt text](https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExczI3NWs2ODlocGVvMDhmcmFsMGk1c3lhdWx1Njk3ajUzbW40Ymx2aCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/7uUX1LZ1HUvW6XnHvh/giphy-downsized-large.gif)

On 5-2, I use 4 lances total (2 down each side), knowing that 2 VL + 1 main (crit or non-crit) is sufficient to kill an Eagle. This allows me to start charging MB for 5-3, and gives me a sufficiently large window to cleanly get the MB off. The additional ~300ms is necessary since otherwise the raven MIRVs can fire, making dodging significantly harder. 

## Vorpal Lance

Similar to other VL-based speedrunning ships (Jeria, Exarch), using VL early on in a wave is recommended as that helps avoid RNG incurred by invader movement. This allows for easily replicable speedruns, as the invader positioning from one run to another is typically pretty minor. For more details, we refer readers to the play styles section, and particularly the discussion on low variance approaches (which is typically recommended). 

Another important technique is the idea of a "VL sweep", where the player moves from one side of the screen to the other and fires VLs at critical points. Typically, it is best to look for points where the largest number of invaders overlap, while making sure VLs are evenly dispersed. 

![alt text](https://i.ibb.co/dG4f7T5/wraith-vl-copy.png)

The image above represents one such VL sweep. Each blue line represents a VL (where they were dispersed from left to right) and each numbered green line represents one main burst. Because I swept from left to right, I started with a single main burst that hit the bottom left Heron, before sweeping across and using 4 VL.

Since I am on the right side after sweeping, I'm in position to then use my 2nd main burst to clean up that side (note that I was lucky here; without the crit the wave would not die). Note that if the Heron and Raven on the right side line up, then it's easy to use at least 1 VL down the intersection to not require a lucky main crit. 

Finally, since there's a roughly 600 millisecond downtime between each burst, it gives more than enough time to get back on the left and finish the final top left Eagle. 

In GIF form, this wave is below.

Another example can be seen below (in both image and GIF form). In this example, the width of a VL is large enough to consistently hit a center Raven along with the raven in outer columns, so there is no need to waste an additional VL solely focused on the center. This allows for the right Heron to be killed instantly.

### VL Convergence

In certain situations, the gap between invaders may be too large for immediate VL to hit all enemies (this is common in 3-Eagle setups in Acts 5/6, for example). 

There are typically two schools of thought, and the correct answer is dependent on a variety of factors such as number of VL (if you have a high count, there's no need to hope for invader convergence) and ability to MB (if you can use MB/MBc then the dependency on convergence is significantly lessened), along with other small characteristics such as number of sparrows.

As a result, in certain cases it may be beneficial to not immediately use all VLs, instead opting to hope for invader alignment to save time and required number of VLs.

**Remark:** This strategy is notoriously RNG-dependent, even more than other strategies detailed in this markdown file. I would only recommend it if it's a significant time save and the rest of the mission is very consistent, since saving time elsewhere in the mission will almost always be less painful. 

### Sparrow VL Sweeps

For these types of waves, a high amount of accuracy is required, particularly to guarantee that the gaps between each VL is small enough to avoid any invaders not getting killed between pairs of VL. Unfortunately, these waves can oftentimes require a high amount of RNG, depending on the exact composition and number of VLs you have.

The below wave is "relatively" easy to sweep compared to other invader compositions that are more sparrow-heavy. Because the prior waves (not shown here) was dense with a single high-hp enemy, I chose to use MBs, resulting in a high cooldown entering 5-4. 

Looking at the invader composition, there are 2 sparrows on the outside of each side, so I had chosen to use 1 VL to track down each of these sparrows. When you start your sweep, no invaders will have moved, so you can precisely fire the first VL to hit the top left Raven, the Sparrow, and the bottom left Raven. The three remaining VL were divvied up between the remaining enemies, with 2 dedicated to the Heron and one dedicated to the left sparrow (where I then hope the back Raven aligns).

![alt text](https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExbWNkbWszazI3NTR2aXo4cG1laGc2NG56aGxkbDZsbXU0cGx6djcybiZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/fjVI0aTjvCSzCr29Tr/giphy.gif)

A very similar idea is used here. Since I enter with 5 lances, I try to disperse them symmetrically where each Heron receives 2 VL and then the middle Raven receives the last VL. I mark both of the outermost sparrows with 1 VL, and then another inner VL that targets the inner Raven. 

![alt text](https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExdzAxZmhqeDBiZ3NpajhnenJrYjE0dWI0dTE3aGZ2a3dnc3p2NXZ2ZiZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/D0S4cz8w9jlWgppZHZ/giphy.gif)

For these types of sweeps, the key is to go fast as to avoid invaders drifting too much, which can lead to uncomfortable situations where VLs completely miss. 

## Mega Bomb

The most underrated component of Wraith is the importance of MB. It is recommended to never have MB cooldown fully recovered since it typically indicates missed opportunities. For example, the time between entering 3-1 and entering 4-1 is often close to 12 seconds (assuming only a 3-1 MB is used), which is why it is often advantageous to use an additional MB in act 3 (for example, MB on 3-1, 3-2 or 3-1, 3-3).

For general details about MB, I refer users to the [Proxymar guide](https://p2myth.club/en/Cookbook/Proxymar), which covers much of the MB basics. 

Now for specific techniques:

While other common speedrunning MB ships (such as Proxymar or Kibarrax) recommend maximizing MBc (mega bomb core) damage, Wraith is a bit different. Because VL benefits most in scenarios where numerous invaders align, it is advantageous to instead MBc only the invaders with the highest hp. 

One such case can be seen below, but the more common scenario is the 1 Vulture + 2 Eagle configuration, where (depending on number of VL) it is frequently better to instead use MBc on the highest hp enemy (Vulture), and then allow VLs to cleanup the remaining Eagles. This is particularly common in Community missions, for example. 

![alt text](https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExNTRlNzdzdnlna2VvdnR4aXh0NWFzdnllbmk0cGNrejZ2NHd3dm5jYyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/tf83BKGrvsxGL3akP6/giphy-downsized-large.gif)

Additionally, because both VL and Wraith's main fire quickly, it is difficult to pre-charge MBs for the next wave like Proxymar of Kibarrax, both of which benefit from the delay incurred by MS. This can lead to MBs that are positionally disadvantageous (such as being forced to sit lower when charging/firing MB), which is where the Lambda apex is useful. Darts are typically the biggest threat, since they are fast moving and (almost always) perfect tracking, which makes for difficulty finding safe MB positions while still reaching all invaders. 



## Apexes 

- Gamma: In most situations, Gamma ends up being the better choice. This is because conservation of VL is vital in later acts, and it gives you extra leeway when sitting at 4 VL. However, this does mean certain early-act MBs can be a bit tight. 

An example where Gamma Wraith is highly recommended. With only 4 VL consistently landing a sweep where the entire opening party is killed is difficult. Other examples can be found in the "Sparrow VL Sweeps" section, as many of those wave configurations are easier with the additional VL.

- Lambda: I personally prefer this apex (mostly due to aesthetics), since it makes extra early MBs much easier (since you can sit significantly lower and avoid enemy bullets)

An example where Lambda Wraith would be necessary. Given such a wave configuration, MB is highly recommended due to the sparrows in the back, but the Eagle's tracking pellets make it difficult to find a position where avoiding death is difficult except sitting at the bottom of the screen.
