The first round of this competition has ended, The results of each group have been posted at "Events-Schedule-Results" in this website~ First of all, congratulations to the two members of Group 19, "Dereck Leigh" and "Avewpxem", for their first place in the first round! They recorded 2:17.87 and 2:04.99+10s with Krillou and Saber respectively, after the Saber gained a +10s debuff, the two were close, The total time of their group is 4:32.86. In second place are the two players in Group 10, "Dubguy" and "æ˜ŸèŽ¹", they and their Antioch and Saber won a total of 4:33.02 in 2:14.14 and 2:08.84+10s, the difference with the first-place combination was only 0.16s, and the bite was very tight. The third-place combination was the 28th group consisting of "Ultimate Phase" and "å“‡å’”å’”", The Vani-Vith and Antioch were used, respectively, 2:04.02+2:38.29=4:42.31, was 9.29s latter than the second-place combination.

The second round has officially begun, and there are still 36 groups of 72 players competing together, and you can see a total of 85 players through the in-game community interface, so minus 1 war correspondent, and 12 are spectators (Yeah~

This time, the level configuration is still a combination of Armored+Shielded enemy aircraft,the 1st and 2nd Acts are Armored, and the rest are Shielded, I personally think the difficulty is decent, after all, without the threat of Boomerangs, the pressure to dodge the bomb will be much less.As of Beijing time 17:00, we can see there's a colony of Photurius, scattered landing, you can see a few different fighters (everyone got "debuff"=none got "debuff", right?) Those 8 sparrows in the front of 5-1 can be a sucker cause one of them always come to you and make you have an orgasm, but this can't be a problem to Photurius I guess, just charge a laser at the bottom and rush up to release the SEMP and kill them allâ€”â€”â€”â€”here I have to praise the sensible of SEMP, when reaching the maximum level and you grants 10 bonus damage(unlike the Destructive Wave of BEMP still costs I mean FUCK YOU!!) If you can make good use of these 10 noble AOE damage points when racing or saving your ass, you can get excellent results, for example slaughter sparrows; so good luck with that~
