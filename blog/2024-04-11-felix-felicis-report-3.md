The second round of this competition has ended, The results of each group have been posted at "Events-Schedule-Results" in this website~ First of all, congratulations to the two members of Group 10, "Dubguy" and "星莹", for their first place in the second round! They recorded 2:23.46+5s and 2:38.97 with Photurius and Jn'Dur respectively, after the Photurius gained a +5s debuff, the two were close, The total time of their group is 5:07.43.

The third round has officially begun, and there are still 36 groups of 72 players competing together, and you can see a total of 79 players through the in-game community interface, so minus 1 war correspondent, and 6 are spectators (Yeah~

This time, the level configuration is still a combination of Hull+Armored enemy aircraft,the 1~3 Acts are Hull, and the rest are Armored, I personally think the difficulty is decent. As of Beijing time 23:00, we can see there's a lot of Fujin and Von Braun, some of other plains also; and good luck with that~
