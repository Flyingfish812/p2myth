Welcome to the first test blog post after the revival of the blog session. I will just say whatever comes to mind here.

Since our reconstruction on January 29, 2024, this website has received enthusiastic help and support from many players. I am incredibly grateful to everyone for their assistance.

Some of you might recall a statement at the bottom of the English version homepage of the old website, addressing some unpleasant experiences within the community. When the server of the old site crashed and I decided to completely rebuild the website, I contemplated whether to replicate that statement on the homepage of this current version. However, I opted to consign it directly to the trash can. Hence, players browsing this site won't find that statement anymore.

As the current website administrator, I aspire for players to engage in discussions, share their gaming insights, and collectively uphold the community spirit of Phoenix 2 players. While the core content of the website has been mostly updated and the frequency of updates has gradually decreased, I still welcome players to provide their suggestions and feedback in the game community or through the feedback links on this site, whether it pertains to the website or the game itself.

Lastly, I want to express my gratitude to all players for their support and companionship throughout the journey with Phoenix 2.
