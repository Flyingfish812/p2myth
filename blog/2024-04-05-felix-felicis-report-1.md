Every Shots You Got🔈🔈Every Scores You Gain🎉🎉

Through the schedule, we can see that there are 36 groups, 2 people in each group so there are 72 players competing together, but the game community interface shows that there are 74 players, so who are the extra 2 :)

As of Beijing time 21:00, the 1st contestant is Roger, he and his Saber obtain the grade in 02:01.33; In the top 10 on the list, there are 8 of them with Vorpal Lance, the proportion reached 80%, and we can see the superiority of AOE weapons in competition~ The 2nd which is Corsair left behind 1.97s, that's close, and the 3rd Vani-Vith is 0.72s to catch Corsair

As for the level configuration, which is pretty normal, the 1、2 and 6 Acts are Sinister Shielded , the 3~5 Acts are Armored, those who can't figure out whether the Intruders are Sinister or not can read the Technical Terms in Beginner's Guide~ And we got every thing, that Heron in 4-2 is a bitch and maybe many players curse it for again and again; those two Ravens in 6-3 with their Laser Trakers can be a pain in ass, for those racing guys they can kill them all for damn sure, but for newbies can takes a lot. So good luck with that :)
