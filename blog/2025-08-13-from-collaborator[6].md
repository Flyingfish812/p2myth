**Hello everyone!** This is Tsingpica (菁鸟) here—wishing you a good morning, afternoon, or evening whenever you’re reading this!

Writing my very first blog post has me feeling both excited and a little nervous. If you’ve made it this far, it means my first attempt at website editing was (somewhat?) successful! Moving forward, I’ll be handling content updates for the site, and I’d love to connect with fellow fan creators! Feel free to reach out to me via **QQ** or email at **izumiai.yin@gmail.com**.

First off, a huge thank you to everyone for your incredible support for my fan-fic *Reburn the Galaxy* (银河浴火)! Even with my slow updates, so many of you are still following along—it truly means the world to us! Secondly, massive gratitude for your enthusiasm in the *Fan Goods Showdown*! Above all, I hope we can all continue to share the joy of fanworks!
