This is the third test blog after the resurrection of the blog page, also my second blog; just some assess about Daily Missions.

Daily Mission#3011-SS the Vulture in 5-1 ARE YOU KIDDING ME? 4 T4 Laser MIRV Bloomers present at the same time really scared the hell out of me~ Footage of Reaper-Tau have been collected.

Daily Mission#3012-SSSS Doomsday Bomb in 4-1 was a little attention grabbing whore trying to get my screen time and we got to take care of that slut so it won't kill us. As for Doomsday Super MIRV, which is less threatening than the old type Doomsday MIRV because we don't have to suck up them all, still need us to pay attention to the larger detonation range, cause if you don't then there will be some MIRVs go to the next wave with you and those 2 CRAZY bitches in 4-2 can literally fuck you up. 4 T4 Laser Spreads on 2 Eagles that hiding in the back with their creepy random move can really make us feel thankless and may be like "if I get passed this time then I don't think I wanna take this shit for another fucking time" I mean, why do this to us? How did Laser Spam Mission that always offers us happiness and satisfaction became an awful bitch that makes players wanna squealing while pounding their lovely phone for an hour and a half? If really wanna see how players deal with difficult missions can just add The Hell Dovacoon back and everyone will be happy.

Tomorrow'SSSS will be MIRV Spam with Shields again, that's nice~ I'm looking forward to it
